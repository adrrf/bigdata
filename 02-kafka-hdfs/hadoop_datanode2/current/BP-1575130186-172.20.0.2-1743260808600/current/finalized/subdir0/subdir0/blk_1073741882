Just that the edges don’t fix in properly. There is always air bubble kind of thing on the edge.,Easy to apply and no bubbles. For Rs 150 they send 2 units which is amazing too. Satisfied with the purchase !!,Overall good and easy to apply. Doesn’t cover 100 percent of screen a small gap is there in edges,Adhesive could have been stronger. Popio has great screen guard at much better price.,See if you own an Iphone then popio is the best out there.I got this tempered glass because my last one broke during a fall from the stairs. & my last one was from popio too. So I odered another & the prices are a steal (like seriously I wonder how do they manage it for so cheap)Buy it without a doubt its a genuine product.PS I like little note they left with the product.,Fed up of buying those exaggerated priced tempered glasses and looking for near by shops to apply it.This product is priced for its value and lesser than other products in the market.Bought this product after scrolling for the best on Amazon and ordered it. Honestly I was never satisfied with any other product like I had with popio product. A big thanks to the team!Bonus is DIY. I never tried anything self before but after following their guide and videos I was able to do it right at first time. I really felt DIY is convenient and no need to worry about finding near by stores who could help us apply/install it.,Got it for my iphone 14pro. Im using my phone with a ringke camo case and this screen protector fits inside snug.Install this glass with the case still on the phone else you may align it imperfectly and may cause fitment problem.Overall a good buy.,The quality is excellent. Refer to the installation video by scanning the QR code on the package; it is very easy to install using the guide stickers. The quality is good, and it covers the screen entirely, leaving just enough space on the edges for the cover.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":75.0,"product_name":"POPIO Tempered Glass Compatible for iPhone 13 / iPhone 13 Pro/iPhone 14 (Transparent) Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage with Installation Kit, Pack of 2","discounted_price":150.0,"rating_count":714.0,"user_id":"AFUWV4HNHDWYGFGEHEMCKPR7HPBA,AH2QS2327TLYTXS5YHXNAS7X7URQ,AHWO6S34K43AUMEEVHEVFHHPOVQQ,AHRPIB6BCK5TKG2R5DH5H3AMRIHA,AEAYBCVEBO7ZZ4SXPQUEWWYXO7IQ,AGE6KNDSGW2KYR7DTGGTFWVWTGGQ,AFRRGE2IZFVEUFIY6PUKMSGSMZ5Q,AG5WZLHPQHKNWCKK3EZQG73THRGA","product_id":"B0B5YBGCKD","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Maintenance,Upkeep&Repairs|ScreenProtectors","about_product":"Compatible Device: iPhone 13 / iPhone 13 Pro / iPhone 14 | Area of coverage : Edge to Edge Full Screen Coverage|Hardness: High hardness level provides protection from accidental drop & scratches|Easy Installation: Contains 2 tempered glass ,2 wet wipe, 2 Dry wipes, 6 Guide Sticker & 2 Dust Absorber|Additional features: Bubble proof, Scratch resistant, Anti fingerprint, Anti-glare, Anti-shatter, Touch sensitive","review_title":"Great product if you don’t mind the edges,Recommended !!,Looks premium,Real value for money however I wish there would have been stronger adhesive,Its a genuine product,Precision!,Does the job perfectly,A perfect fit for iPhone 13 and has transparent edges too.","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/POPIO-Compatible-iPhone-Transparent-Installation/dp/B0B5YBGCKD/ref=sr_1_417?qid=1672895872&s=electronics&sr=1-417"}

Display :Samsung has been already popular for it's AMOLED Displays but i saw some of the reviewers wrote about some display issues here . They might have got some defective Piece. I have no issues with my display . It's been long time i saw a great display like this ... with 120Hz it is Super Smooth.Also , it is very bright on outdoors and can decrease it to very low while using at low light conditions ( PS : No tint issues )The in display finger print scanner is very fast and didn't faced any issues with it .2. Stereo Speakers :As an extensive multimedia user , this is one of the most favorable feature for me.Believe me , you can't find any other device with such great Sound quality in this price segment , it's almost like flagship devices ..Both the speakers are adequately loud.3. Battery :As a person who's shifting from a normal 60Hz Device phone , i was very worried about the battery life of this device at 120Hz but it surprised me very well ..Initially i thought i would need to switch to 60Hz for better battery life for daily usage.But I didn't even thought this device would give this much great battery life at 120Hz.At 120Hz , I am getting around 7 hours of minimum SOT ( Screen on Time ).The maximum SOT i got at 120Hz is 9Hours 13 minutes.I didn't checked battery life at 60Hz because i didn't use it at 60Hz even a single day . The battery life is Excellent.4. Rear Cameras :I am not a very good photographer or something , i am just an ordinary person who use camera occasionally.I was very excited to use the telephoto lens which only can be found on flagship devices and it performs very well..Added Some Camera Samples above ( Pic 1 : Ultrawide , Pic 2 : Telephoto [ Pic may not be clear as it was when taken due to compression of the image while uploading )Both the three Cameras ( Primary + Ultrawide + Telephoto ) performs very well.If you're a camera guy you should definitely check this out.5. Performance & RAM Management :I'm not a gamer , I use my device for daily usage of social media , ott platforms , Calls , messages etc. but i use it extremely.I didn't faced any kind of heating issues with the device until now.Also ,Ram management of the Device is excellent , I am a person who uses 4-5 appsbackground at single time and i didn't have any issues of closing down the apps .6. ONE UI :I was a stock Android guy , but One UI actually surprised me , it is very well optimised and very user-friendly for single hand usage..initial days i found it little hard to use the stock menu of one Ui but I'm now got used to it.PS : I didn't found any kind of ads on my device as i didn't sign up or used any samsung Apps.7. Build Quality :Even though its back is made up of plastic , the overall build quality is super Premium the Aluminium frame gives us a feel like using a flagship device..8. Future Proof :  The device has 9 5G Bands , IP68 Rating , Wireless Charging which are very hard to find on any device in this price bracket.IP68 & Wireless Charging are mostly only found on Flagship Devices . Its good to see samsung brings it at lower price.This is the best future proof device as of now.So these are the Major pros i noticed as of now .Now let's move to the Cons.Cons :1. NO HDR SUPPORT ON NETFLIX :  As an extensive multimedia user , i found it very frustrating. even mid range devices offering HDR support on Netflix , Samsungs Flagship Killer doesn't have HDR support.IT WILL NOT BE FIXED VIA OTA UPDATE .2. No 256GB Variant :  This is actually not a problem for most of the people but as a power user who uses Dual sim , i found it little difficult.But if you're a single sim user , luckily it have hybrid solution ..so you can use a Sim card + expandable memory card ...3. Gorilla Glass 3 :  Other competitors are providing atleast GG5 in this price range. But S20 FE 5G has just GG3 ( Which also I'm not sure as it is not mentioned officially anywhere ).But at the end of the day , GLASS IS GLASS & IT WILL BROKE.4. No headphone Jack :  It is not any kind of unusual thing .most of the phones above 30K segment doesn't have headphone jack.So we have to buy 3.5mm to Type C adapter , type c earphones or bluetooth solutions .Note : Only Buy original Samsung type c adapter else it may not support.5. No 25W charger :  It is not actually a con for me as i prefer Low watt charger which is good for battery health and beneficial for long term usage .but it may be a con for you ,  Although the device supports 25W charging . Only 15W charger is provided inside the box .. They should have given 25W inside the box.I didn't have any issues with 15W charger but it would be great if they bundle it with 25W as competitors are way ahead in terms of charging speed.For the reference of Charging speed ,Both 15W & 25W will full charge the device almost at the same time but using 25W you can get about 50% within 30 minutes where as 30% with 15W charger.Full charge time i usually takes is 1hour and 35 minutes.6. Front Camera :  I am not a selfie guy , but if you're a person who's looking for a selfie device just don't buy it . it's not like the front camera quality is really bad or anything but it's not even near to the rear camera quality and you can find better selfie smartphones in this price rangeCONCLUSION :If you're a person who wants a device for normal day to day usage with good battery life , great rear cameras , great performance , better software support , better build quality and use it for more than 3 years & the cons mentioned above doesn't bother youJust buy it , I am sure you won't be disappointed.,It's been about 15 days since I got this phone.  I got it for 29990 on prime day sale. For the price it's good.Pros :1. Camera.  Coming from Poco X2, the camera quality on this is amazing according to the price. It gives you good colours, contrast, focus, and everything that you want. It has OIS which is very apparent while recording. At 4k60 the stability is worse. But set it to  1080p60 and the videos will be amazingly stable. And the main advantage of OIS other than stable video is GREAT night mode shots. Hold the phone stable for a while and along with OIS you will get great photos with accurate colors and nice exposure. Attached samples.2. Display : Absolutely best. Samsung displays are the best. 120hz FHD. Flows smoothly.  Colors and calibration is top notch. Brightness is good but I felt it's a little insufficient under direct sunlight. It's visible but could be better.3. OneUI : The main reason for upgrading to this phone was software. OneUI4.0 is the absolute best android skin right now. It has way too many customisations in it and let's you personalise your phone to a very high degree. Like there's a feature to read out the name of the person who's calling if your wearing headphones. It took me 3 days to fully go through all the settings and change them to my needs. Also Knoxx security is a special mention. Knoxx security is a software and hardware feature in samsung phones which protects your phone from all kinds of attacks and keeps your data safe. Even if it gets stolen you can remotely delete all your data. Secure folder allows you to store data in a separate storage. And many more such good features. While being a very feature rich and storage heavy skin, it still feels very very smooth and fast to use. Unlike MIUI or other skins, it doesn't stutter much and bugs are less.There are many other small pros like good stereo speakers. Nice premium build quality. Good data and wifi speeds. Other such features that you won't notice but definitely make a difference in your experience.Cons1.  Software.  I know I said it's a pro but I say this in the aspect of updates.  This phone was launched in 2021 March in India and samsung promises 3 year android version updates and 1 additional year of security updates.  But there's a lot of confusion regarding if or not this phone will receive Android 14. It will receive A13 for sure. There's a lot of debate on what they will do with14 because of global version launch date being earlier and yada yada. Basically the phones life maybe 2.5 to 3 years if they give a14.  But 1.5 to 2 if not. I researched on the Internet a few people say that it will receive a14 while I was few say it's not. It's hard to say who's correct.  So assume it's not getting a14 if you are going for it.2. Battery.  The battery on this phone is 4500mah and it's good enough for a days use. But that's because I use it lightly. Not much online streaming. No gaming light social media and other usual stuff. If you use it even a tad bit more heavily, you will run out within a day. If you're going outside for the better part of a day,like a day trip to somewhere nearby,it's better keep a power bank handy. In terms of Screen on time numbers, I once got 7 hours of sot on light usage, 1 hr YouTube and 1.5 hr streaming. I was at home and used wifi all the time.I got 3 hrs sot when I went outside for a day trip. I took many photos and videos and the phone shutdown before I could reach home. On a mixed use day,  you can get 4.5 to 5.5 hours of sot.Final verdict : The life of the phone in terms of Software Support is not great but you will get on time updates and almost no bugs in the software. So if you want to buy it you can and exchange it after maybe 2 years for other models. But if you planning on using it for longer than 2 years,  better avoid it. In the upcoming diwali and dussera sales,  the price might further drop to 25k even. I am just speculating but keep in mind your requirements and go accordingly.As always amazing delivery by Amazon.","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":49.0,"product_name":"Samsung Galaxy S20 FE 5G (Cloud Navy, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI & Additional Exchange Offers","discounted_price":37990.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AEGEOVAES62OFGQTSPSDSQ5U7SHA,AGMBYTP5MS3JCQZ2NHRA3L2FTC6A","product_id":"B08VB57558","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"5G Ready powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-Core processor, 8GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 1TB, Android 11.0 operating system and dual SIM|Triple Rear Camera Setup - 12MP (Dual Pixel) OIS F1.8 Wide Rear Camera + 8MP OIS Tele Camera + 12MP Ultra Wide | 30X Space Zoom, Single Take & Night Mode | 32MP F2.2 Front Punch Hole Camera|6.5-inch(16.40 centimeters) Infinity-O Super AMOLED Display with 120Hz Refresh rate, 1080 x 2400 (FHD+) Resolution \"|4500 mAh battery (Non -removable) with Super Fast Charging, FAst Wireless Charging & Finger Print sensor|IP68 Rated, MicroSD Card Slot (Expandable upto 1 TB), Dual Nano Sim, Hybrid Sim Slot, 5G+5G Dual stand by|5G Ready powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-Core processor, 8GB RAM, 128GB internal memory expandable up to 1TB, Android 11.0 operating system and dual SIM|Triple Rear Camera Setup - 12MP (Dual Pixel) OIS F1.8 Wide Rear Camera + 8MP OIS Tele Camera + 12MP Ultra Wide | 30X Space Zoom, Single Take & Night Mode | 32MP F2.2 Front Punch Hole Camera","review_title":"WORTH BUY !

I love it because it's supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it's okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector's are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it'll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it's help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":60.0,"product_name":"Ambrane 2 in 1 Type-C & Micro USB Cable with 60W / 3A Fast Charging, 480 mbps High Data, PD Technology & Quick Charge 3.0, Compatible with All Type-C & Micro USB Devices (ABDC-10, Black)","discounted_price":199.0,"rating_count":602.0,"user_id":"AHH2TIJJ2IGD5H3DJO3FROUHRRSQ,AF37X7ZH7JPA6H5Q64NV6QFIBCYA,AFKT7LV4XE6XJ2VTHCBHPQECW2RQ,AE7GGDNBOHD2JQ2X5JPD666SAQOQ,AENNAVVG4GBJKDQKJXQUEKQKTXGQ,AFPSO7EYQBYVEJGD4TAT7YFCM6UQ,AFV5W5BR6PKGHPIG3J6TNFK7BSXQ,AHILALAA7Q6SQRTFJVLT75P37FXQ","product_id":"B09CMP1SC8","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","about_product":"Stay ahead and never miss out with a 3A fast charging speed for your devices|It supports Quick Charge 2.0/ 3.0 technology to keep your devices boosted up|Its sturdy design and braided cord are tough enough to withstand 10000+ bends|Crafted for convenience, it allows you to charge and sync data with just one cable|It is widely compatible with all types of Micro USB & Type-C enabled devices","review_title":"Good product,Its good, but micro usb doesn't fit my phone.,Good and useful item,It is very best cable,good,2 in 1 Charging Cable.,Sturdy cable overall,Nice & Best Charger Cabel","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-ABDC-10-Charging-Transmission-Compatible/dp/B09CMP1SC8/ref=sr_1_439?qid=1672895879&s=electronics&sr=1-439"}
