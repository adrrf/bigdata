But here some negative points also here,Buttons or not sturdy some what loose and body parts are like head band are toy plastic, for music full volume is very loundness not lovely to like, make a shout punch in a ear painfull, bass is also very good but overall its always below tha boat products im not a hatter , but if u used a boat product u wont like it, same that if u use sony u wont like boat\uD83D\uDE00,.  If u use no other brands and  zebronics 1st time u become lover to this, still im surprise how they give this product for this price shocking ( aux + type C ) under 700 is shocking bcoz if u go for boat type C product is 1700 aboveZeb or not bad its more ok for this priceSound 4/5  heavy (loud) in full voume looks shouting inside ear , otherwise niceBass : 3.7/5. Not reach boat product , but u wont feel diff if u use for 3 more daysMusic + sound  + vocals i cant separate in this productDurability :3.8/5 bcoz they used toy plastic in band, but however not easily breaks, compare to boat 450 its strong onlyOverall i look for a aux + type C + best bass effect, so at last above all are not reach my concern\uD83D\uDE06, now i ordered zeb bang pro(699)rsIf it also sound loud thing, then i shutdown with boat 400 (900rs) segmentNote: if i get boat 660 in initially , i wont go for these alllllll). Bcoz unbeaten and full fil my all expect thanknu\uD83D\uDE0A,Sound quality is good, built quility is ok as per pricing . I got it for 600 rs totally worth it. Its been more 10 days since i am using. Its working totally fine.,Sound and other qualities are doing well except ear cuffs are getting detached easily and no firm support for them,Pons-They are good for the price they come. Sound is decent.Battery life is long enough for 2 days (not countinously).The wired features is a charm if battery goes dead. Noise cancellation is also decent.Coming to the bad points.Build Quality is a  little Cheap according to the price , the hinges shouldn't be used that much it will lose it's grip.Also the Bluetooth is not that grt , if you are on a vehicle and connected your phone you will hardly hear any song.The connectivity is a issue. The dual connect is good but their is a latency of about 2-3 second when switching from one to another.That's all, You can buy this if your budget is less and as a student this is the best headphones at this price range.,Sound :* Great Bass* Vocal and Instrument Seperation : Average ( To be expected like this for this price)Connectivity :*Fast BT connection.*BT disconnects when AUX connectedComfortable to wear since its over the earAverage build qualityOverall 4/5,I like this product. I use it everyday while travelling to college far away places.,If you are getting this product within 1000 rupees then it is a good product for you. ☺️,It is overall a nice product","rating":3.8,"discount_percentage":57.0,"product_name":"ZEBRONICS Zeb-Thunder Bluetooth Wireless Over Ear Headphone FM, mSD, 9 hrs Playback with Mic (Black)","discounted_price":599.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFMBNWKA4H7GP6PAHPYY25A6Z4HQ,AGMBVEO4J5JYGUM6X5INZMD4FRRQ,AHKQXI6UBPLTL65RPYN7PJ24ELLA,AGWRIXDLH7IBOX4O6L3MW66IJJPQ,AHPV4OCEUB4DZDFNOPHTRE4FHN5A,AG4PTAEZKGTC4UKZX5RSZKK32JIA,AHPD7DFCKP7UFYA4KRGXU3BLR7DQ,AHSUCDSAY4VEIJ3KL6M7NSFL2W3A","product_id":"B07L8KNP5F","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|On-Ear","about_product":"Comfortable Design: Beat the workday blues with music on Zeb-Thunder wireless headphone that comes in an ergonomic design a perfect fit and design for long hours use.

The front and back side covers are good, feels smooth and premium. I give it a 4 star considering the below points..Also, Thanks to Amazon for Superfast Delivery.1. Paper quality - nice, I used Ball pens, Sketch pens and also inkpens. all cases no soaking of ink.2. Binding - Spiral Binding and qality is good and attractive.3. Sturdiness - Here it could have been a little better, considering the price tag.4. Light Weight - Binding and Paper quality is nice, still lite weght. That's a Plus.5. Writing Experience - Better than average available notbooks in similar pricetag.,First off, the notebook design is great, pages are nice and smooth, but a bit on the thinner side. The subject dividers are thicker than other pages.The QC has some issues, as of the one unit i ordered for testing this product @118 rs some pages were folded up from the corners and become larger when unfolded as depicted in the picture above. Many pages were glued onto each other hence, tearing some part when flipping them again, illustrated in the picture added above.Its an absolute steal deal for rs 118 per piece as no other notebook competes in the spiral bind 300 page market, and notebooks of about 200 pages non spiral bound of a simillar size are sold for @84 rs as of writing this review.The only downside I found besides the QC is that it doesn't include an index page, otherwise; it has some games, riddles and a notes pages like other notebooks and the first page is dedicated to the owners details and contact N.O. Great to see it present.Overall i recommend this product because of the value for money and the quality. I understand my unit was a one off as other reviews don't seem to mention this. Will update after using this for a few more weeks,The product is worth the money. The paper quality was good and it has six separations for six different subjects.,Valu for moneyPremium quality,,I ordered 3, only one copy was a bit damaged from the binding.,I got all the same design notebook.
