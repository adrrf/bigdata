Price is little high,I have been using this mouse since 2019, and I have to say, logitech built quality is second to none.I have throwed, and bashed this mouse on my table during my gaming sessions, yet this mouse still survives.Even the rubberised grips are still there. Go for it without any hesitation.For those having button issues, I have so far, replaced my left click and middle click button . I started developing these issues after 2 years . It's a simple soldering job to fix it. You can get replacement switches from tanotis. Now they work as good as new.,,So I've been using this mouse for quite a long time and believe this is the best mouse so far I've ever used. But the problem is with the cable, as another customer said the cable quality is not good the outer portion of cable from usb and from mouse side coming out and the inside wires can be visible. Even though mouse runs good but this is not good for long term usage. Other than this is pretty good mouse we have.,At close to 150g, it is ridiculously heavy for fast-paced gaming. For chill RPG titles it'll do fine, but if you wanna play something like Apex Legends on this, forget it. The shape of the mouse is super comfortable, only mouse I've owned that didn't give me any wrist pain even after 4-5 hours continuous usage. Cable quality is what you expect, like it's not even braided. Since, it's an older generation mouse, it doesn't have the double-clicking issue Logitech is infamous for.After all that, I would say in 2022, just don't buy it, it's too old to justify spending any money on.,You know and love Logitech. This is one of their best products.,I'd say this is hands down my favorite budget/gaming mouse. It's nice and comfy, works properly, and also has multiple buttons to assign them to various actions, which is not just limited to games, you can assign them to windows actions as well.Have been using this for the last 2 years and I have absolutely no complaints, although my brother thinks that it looks like a beetle :)","rating":4.6,"discount_percentage":31.0,"product_name":"Logitech G402 Hyperion Fury USB Wired Gaming Mouse, 4,000 DPI, Lightweight, 8 Programmable Buttons, Compatible for PC/Mac - Black","discounted_price":1995.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFLGIDPC5GTJ4ET22CVZHSHBYCJA,AGFIU57KQ27B2HIIHLNRXEX4LD3A,AH2HEAF5KSG36DBJZATRGPWMQFFQ,AEHFXUDWPL2CJNEDKMN5473JESNA,AGUZ3J4FHC3D4PBXVYJSJLCYLR6A,AEE5TKO2YQMMVIBAGMEE4BQS6ZHQ,AHHWAZU4DKWHDYX6TXUOHE56T5AA,AHOGJRONCJE5ZAJX5CV76QCAKC5A","product_id":"B00NFD0ETQ","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|PCGamingPeripherals|GamingMice","about_product":"HIGH SPEED TRACKING : Fusion engine delivers one of the highest gaming mouse tracking speeds of up to 500 IPS.

It was totally beaten up and inside the batteries of the keyboard ha come loose alsothough I could just pop it back in no problem. Thankfully it works fine, I tested all the keys and they are functional so let's get to the meat of the subject, or paneer if you're vegetarian:I think this keyboard's performance will vary according to your use case. For me the primary objective was to get an android compatable keybaord since I had shifted the majority of my wokrload from my laptop to my tablet. I checked the internet and settled on this little guy becaue of teh glowing reviews and from my friend who had the ink variant of the keyboard. I bought it along with the Logitech Pebble M350 wireless mouse since it came in a bundle and honestly I don't regret it. Both of them fir very well into my work type and they've made my life a lot more easier.This is of course a bluetooth keyboard and it does not have any wireless dongles hidden away in the chasse(I checked). The keyboard has no backlighting as expected from a wireless eyboard that runs on regular pen torch batteries, and from my friends experience this battery will last you a long time. The major feature of this wireless keyboard over the other brands in teh market is the ability to switch between 3 bluetooth capable devices with the press of a button. Now I personally thought that I wouldn't be using this feature all that much since I was plaaning on using this keyboard for my android tablet. But then I realised that, I could set up my laptop as a second device and switch between my tablet and laptop without any issues making it easier to type out papers on my laptop and responding to texts, emails on my android tablet at the same time. Nowadays I can't stop using this feature since I have my phone, tablet and laptop paired to this keybaord and my productivity has become much more efficent. It is honestly very neat.The keys are rounded which is much more pleasant to type on than let's say square keys, and the slight inclination of the keyboard serves as good angle that reduces finger fatigue while typing. This comes with no wrist rest so people who have had hand injuries should either look for another keyboard or buy the wrist rest seperately. Teh keys are membrane keys and they feel a bit stiff in my honest opinion, but nonetheless it has a good feedback and the typing experience is very comfortable. It does not have a number pad as you migth have seen from the product images, so if you are someone that crunches a lot of numbers ine excel you might want to skip this keyboard.The latency is quite low from my perspective, I don't think they have that crispy Logitech Lightspeed tech built into it though, but you won't be using this for gaming, and if you are planning to then please don't. This keyboard performs horribly in gaming, and I mean it's terrible. This is a keybaord targeted at people who do a lot of typing across multiple devices and it is built with portability in mind. If I am ambitious enough I can probably stuff this keyboard into my pocket, because of how small it is. Like my friends say I have small hands, well this keyboard was probably designed for a rat because my hands are huge compared to this keybaord. Sometimes while I am resting my hand on the homerow my ring finger accidentally presses one of teh mushy media buttons at the top and everything I am doing goes into stasis. But that is more of a me problem than a problem with this keyboard. It does come with arrow keys which is very surprising. They actually managed to squeeze it in.I mean that's pretty much it for this keybaord. Don't buy it for Rs.3k I suggest waiting for a discount because this thing is certainly not worth that much. I would say this is like a Rs.1.4K keyboard but that's just my opinion. If you are buying this for the android experience then I suggets buying it bunded with the mouse. Because both of them kind of complete each other. With that being said I'm going to conclude my review.,Mouse came turned on. Apart from that no issues discovered till now, it going good.,It’s one of the best budget keyboards I have ever used.. the membrane keys are very soft and easy to click… not lift off weight … easy on the fingers … it’s been around 1yr since I bought this keyboard … and Iam using it ever since … no issues so far and Iam highly satisfied with my purchase… definitely gonna recommend it …. Very good typing experience so far,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61lIMl3tS4L._SY88.jpg,Cons:No Caps Lock indicatorHeight isn't adjustableNo backlight,The key travel is very very less, please keep that in mind. Otherwise a decent product at the price range.,I bought this in combination with a Logitech Pebble M350 Bluetooth Mouse for the sole purpose of using it with my iPad. It has made my tasks easier and with recent iPadOS updates, there are tons of shortcuts that make iPad experience more productive. Since I was going for a retro-looking device, I chose Sand color. Makes me nostalgic about the old school computer devices that had similar finish. Connectivity is fast. You just switch it on and it's connected to your primary device in a matter of seconds, even less. They keys are not silent but at the same time not loud enough to disturb your environment.You can connect upto 3 devices and switch between them seamlessly with the push of a button. I'm also using the setup for gaming. Will maybe update later about that experience.Final Comments: Ergonomic, economic, portable and lovely! Recommend buy for all who need to get work done fast.,This Keyboard is awesome , It has a flawless connectivity and a great size for portability . Just that it is not fitted with a lift at the back and I miss the backlight design , but it is a value for money product . Works flawlessly with mac as well as Windows.","rating":4.5,"discount_percentage":17.0,"product_name":"Logitech K380 Wireless Multi-Device Keyboard for Windows, Apple iOS, Apple TV Android or Chrome, Bluetooth, Compact Space-Saving Design, PC/Mac/Laptop/Smartphone/Tablet (Dark Grey)","discounted_price":2640.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AE7D3RJLZB7FRIEHCAY6O2ATRJDQ,AGR6MSMT6NDHTYUYWIF25PIVEEQQ,AGDGOIKF2V3IFHQLZ7QSCAYQTRNQ,AHQ6LZRLPWZRHXDESLTHYTIQPKVA,AHNLTNUGEDFJQZDRMZTHFFEV6YHA,AE4ENCSAVBVYJVFC3GMNMRDSD2KA,AEBRFXFON7LZTJCLJHVYUTGAG4JA,AEA7RJWIWRHGUYKUP6LJBPRSZCDA","product_id":"B0148NPH9I","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Keyboards,Mice&InputDevices|Keyboards","about_product":"Multi-Device Connectivity : Pair up to 3 wireless devices at once with the simple touch of an Easy-Switch button.

No concerns regarding the time taken or the print quality. The only markdown for this product is the setup. The user manual is brief and doesn't explain how to setup the printer wirelessly or by usb. We spent a good hour having to look through the online manual and you tube videos to understand how this was configured and through trial and error, we managed to get it all ready.,Easy to install,Good print and enough for home usage but installation is quite tedious.,Budget product. Installation was a headache. Did not know if it was done or not. But wireless printing is working somehow. Gets the job done.,The printer is good for personal use. It's working fine till now. It's easy to use. Print quality is also good. Scanning is easy and it's image is fine. Canon Product quality is good to say.,Shipment received in time on 25 th Sept. Due to lack of time i could test the product recently. It is working fine. Wi Fi set up could not perform successfully, i shall try again shortly. Other function are working satisfactory. Only worried is that the cost of its Ink Cartridges.,Printing photo's ar totally not clear,Pros:1) The Best / only wifi all in one printer in the range of 5k with ink saver (so called).2) Low usage required & low maintenance: Thought of buying ink tank but learnt from friends that it's suitable for heavy printing and when they didn't use it for a while repairs needed. Hence decided to go for inkjet with low cost maintenance. This doesn't require daily print like ink tanks.3)  product is solid built and no issues observed so far. Many long term reviews also confirmed flawless working for years so decided this model.4) Print quality: Black is very good but colour is average. Does the job for kids school project purpose.5) Easy setup : It's very easy to setup if you are techy. Setting up WiFi took little bit of time (an hour). I hate reading manuals and it was first time with a printer at home.6) Wi-Fi printing via mobile is a breeze with Canon Selphy app. Easy photo editor by canon is also quite useful /handy.Cons:1) Black is good but Colour is pretty average. Like I said good enough for home /students purpose.2) Not happy with cartidges supplied by Canon. They seem to fill only half or less for demo purpose. It gave around 100 pages for black and 15-20 pages of color with lowest quality settings (where in they claim 250 Black and 100 color). Both cartidges were almost empty and mobile app started showing the same.2) Ink cartidges cost & yield: The cost cartridges seems to be increasing (when I was purchasing this it was around 500 for black but now it's around 600) and I had no faith on the yield based on what I have got with stock cartidges. It's not worth buying cartidges so go for refill.3) We only find CL 57S Which is small. Where is Cl 57 (large size) ? Couldn't find anywhere online.","rating":3.9,"discount_percentage":17.0,"product_name":"Canon PIXMA E477 All-in-One Wireless Ink Efficient Colour Printer (White/Blue)","discounted_price":5299.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHV4RBRC5YCXKIOQC2Y4PFTQPZJQ,AEXNDM5WOVFGYVZEG5WIZCIJVN6Q,AFU42F26AWWMHVXXPQBCV3TMJCQA,AHRL6UH5ZPAO25IZNBKRHIBU75MQ,AFNKZKUMVGEZPPAHKKX66IV6RJ6Q,AEK6GCTCP57ROUFQRMAH5X3NVLOQ,AEMKNUIMZACX7TT5FMUOPSS5YNMQ,AE47Z7OIMUONNOFNS74AL5G3SEUQ","product_id":"B01JOFKL0A","category":"Computers&Accessories|Printers,Inks&Accessories|Printers","about_product":"Printer type: Ink Efficient; Functionality All-in-one (print, scan, copy), Scanner type: Flatbed CIS Scanner; Output: Color; Connectivity: USB, WiFi, WiFi Direct, Google Cloud Print,Canon Print Service, PIXMA Cloud Link, Canon SELPHY; Scanner Resolution - 600 x 1200dpi; Apple Airprint - No|OS Compatibility - Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 7 SP1, Windows Vista SP2.

I got re use product in package 1st time but that speakerone side high sound to left side ,so i replace that product 2nd time product box not good but product good after check there are no problem face now i am use 4month  this head phone this is good gaming Pubg, free fire, battle field 5, Gta v,third per shooting game playing my experience good.  please check after buy , one time replace then i got this. and remember offer time buy this product this product price up and down i buy big billion day.,With USB Connector, This headphone is good but not good for Base Music,Headphones are nice and a comfy. Sound is decent and loud. However as it doesn't have it's own volume manager and only controls the systems volume, I have to keep the PC volume to 1% and still have to reduce volumes individually on apps and browser. SO somewhat of an inconvenience for me as I don't listen to things in loud volumes.Mic works fine however it s not exactly adjustable. Solid core surrounded by a spring so you have to bend it but it slowly goes back to an extent and the movement is limited.Cable is covered by very thick coating and seems durable, however, it is not free from interference. If your phone is near the cable you will hear the interference in the headphones.The light on the mic is static and does not indicate the 'mute' status. Can be turned off alongside with other RGB lights on the headphone.You can hear some whine when some software is trying to access the mic and nothing is playing in the headphones.,1. 7.1 is Just Awesome2. The Software Is Very Good3. comfort Is Just Excellent, Not that Good noise cancelling4. I bought it for 1600 and in that price u can't get this type of product5. If u have 2k budget try to get boat im300 it will give better comfort and noise cancellation.,The product is nice. For the price, it has good features. It is a bit heavy tho. The ears heat up easily and you can start sweating easily.,The product is as displayed and is really well built. But the upper part is of metal which adds to it premium-ness makes it heavy. Someone who only uses AirPods or other TWS will find it difficult to adjust. The wire is long and braided and the controller works great too. No need for any external drivers to use the control in mobile devices as well. Works absolutely fine with OTG without compromising noise cancellation.Overall a great deal for ₹1299/-,Early reviewLiked:Looks are greatWire goodSound good bass good treble goodMic level is goodInterface acceptableCan hear sound going from left to right  when enemy runningWorks on my mobile with otg good sound makes me happyDisliked:Fake add that it's 7.1 there was no demo either how it becomes 7.1 like there should be an audio file to demo 7.1 or some sort of test to prove so actually it's just a more organized stereo headset.... But it's OK for this price like many other I know.... Real 7.1 will be Dam expensive and can't be sure how human ear will respond to that technique.... At this stage I am still not convinced that is even possible in the headset anyway...Microphone isnt steady and irritates keeps on going below lip levelMust have Been detachable atleast.please dont search for light in mic as its not in the white model ....one gets  confused upon watching videosPeople complain earpain but they don't understand it isn't heavy or tight but the deep loud bass causes earpain which they don't adjust.Buy it.,Great sound. Great Base. Great quality. I felt llil bit heavy but thats Okay!!.
