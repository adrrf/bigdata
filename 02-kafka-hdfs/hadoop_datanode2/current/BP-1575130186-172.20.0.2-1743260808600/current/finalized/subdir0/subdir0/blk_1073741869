My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models","rating":3.9,"discount_percentage":21.0,"product_name":"Redmi Note 11 Pro + 5G (Stealth Black, 8GB RAM, 256GB Storage) | 67W Turbo Charge | 120Hz Super AMOLED Display | Additional Exchange Offers | Charger Included","discounted_price":22999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHALPOEUQFGXEZR6NQ64ZI3EIYXA,AFJEOV652OA6P6CPXI6U34PC677A,AEMQXD272M5OGFOTZDB3PBM2KSWA,AHTNHTN3WQ3NHVW27TWJLRMQDG4A,AGXGWVE46AD3MXJRAA75U5VYV4VA,AEQIOSXDNEWT7VHJIRG5AVN2L7XA,AGZV3QEQWGL37PYNL6FF2FV25Z7A,AETFDFDDPV5V47KNM2ZNBXJ3BCJQ","product_id":"B09T2S8X9C","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"Superior performance with Snapdragon 695 5G.
