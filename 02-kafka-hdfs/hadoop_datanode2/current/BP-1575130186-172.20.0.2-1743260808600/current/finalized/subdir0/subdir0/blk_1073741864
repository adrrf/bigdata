And the battery also lasts only 3-4 days, just hope that in the future, if I update the software, then the double tap option will come.,Watch is user friendly, UI is great.Calling feature is great.This watch is different from others in music playing in watch speaker.Great experience.Watchfaces option is good.We can add watchfaces as we can.In my other watch this feature is missing.Love this watch.,This Smartwatch is perfect for beginners who's buy first time smartwatch. ninja call pro plus is recently launched so it comes with latest features and specifications. Display Is top Notched and and brightness is enough for use at outdoor. Heart measure and Spo2 is well accurate all sensors are efficiently worked.

Calling experience is also very nice, speaker and microphone is quite decent sufficient voice at indoor. But battery should be better it has require charge 1 time in day. 3D curved display give awasome visual experience. Strap quality is very soft and female also use it very smoothly. So overall it has best smartwatch under 2K Display, Calling, Sensors, Bulit quality, Battery Back-up, sports Mods, Waterproof, etc. You should definitely go for this one. Satisfied Product.\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDD25\uD83D\uDC4D,This watch is very good but 1 problem im using this watch from 1 week and a few days back its pixels were droping, the screen was not working properly but after restarting, it was working properly and from then i didn,t face that problem again.,Nice watch with good UI interface with calling feature.

Color is typical samsung style with oversaturated greens. Interesting to note that JN1 is also being used in Samsung's new F23.Thermal management is very poor. Device heats up in normal usage within minutes if the screen brightness is high. Same is the case when camera app is opened/simple games on flipkart gamezone are played. There are reports on youtube of narzo50's camera shutting down on hot days.Above scenarios and 120Hz adaptive refresh rate also drain battery like crazy.Speaker and earpiece do not have crispiness (upper treble), instead sound like white noise. Earpiece volume is low. So is the speaker volume when on call. On the other hand, speaker volume is decent while playing back videos.Flashlight is half as bright as normal smartphones. I don't really know if company did cost cutting here, or its a software bug.No fm radio and secondary mic.Minor features I missed if shifting from miui to realmeui - e.g. the gallery app is not as good as miui one, requiring more taps for basic opeeations like viewing whatsapp images folder.Mediocre ram management with realmeui 2, android 11.To be fair, I could not find any major bug in realmeui 2.0 so far. The lcd display is fantastic, and very well calibrated with relatively cooler white point, as opposed to yellowish 5500-6500k super amoled. There was no green or purple tint. Touch response was excellent. Screen protector, case, fast charger, usb c cable were present. The phone feels much slimmer than my bulky F22 due to its thin body, 10gm less weight and sleek case. Camera app has full fledged manual mode, something absent from Samsung's F22.Disclaimer: Above impression has been made after using 4 smartphones over last 8 years: Asus Zenfone 5, Redmi 4, Redmi 7A, Samsung F22.Strongly consider other current alternatives too, like Redmi note 11, Poco m4 pro, Poco m4 pro 5g, Redmi note 10t 5g,  Samsung F22, Samsung F23, Moto G42 before buying Narzo 50.More info: Do not fall for bloatwares like glance when setting up the phone. Check as few check boxes as possible before blindly clicking 'I agree'. Turn off content recommendation by going to the Settings -> Additional Settings -> Get Recommendations and switch the green toggle off. To remove bloatwares that cannot be uninstalled usual way, follow excellent guide by youtuber 'tech office' mentioning all realme app names required for adb commands. I was able to uninstall hot apps/games this way.UPDATE:Detailed camera comparison between Samsung F22 and Narzo 50:Samsung's HDR algo seems more sophisticated, narzo unnaturally brightens some shadows too much, there is also some oversharpening.Both cameras choose cool auto white balance, which results in bluer skies but lifeless greeneries even in 'golden hours'. However, narzos colors become more 'hue accurate' after choosing 6000-6500k white point in 'expert mode', whereas samsung still delivers bluish green foliage colors at cloudy white balance. Narzo strangely does some weak auto hdr even in 'expert mode', but samsung fully turns it off in 'pro mode', resulting unusable photos.However, when using night mode, narzo's photos appear more cleaner but less saturated at night.  Gcam 8.5 for narzo is not optimized properly and gives noisy night photos with greenish cast and crushed shadows, much worse than realme's night mode. On the other hand, thereas no gcam and no camera2api support for F22. At night, you can take long exposure shots (upto 8/16/32secs) through 'expert mode' by manually choosing shutter speed in narzo, something you can't do in F22. This however requires tripod support and whenever done properly, the results are very good.You have manual 'film' mode in narzo, whereas you can't even manually set white balance in F22's video mode, as samsung's lower end galaxys don't have 'pro video' mode.,This mobile is suitable for every oneIt's goodBut camara is average,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719puSga96L._SY88.jpg,Good quality,Very good phone .Iam very happy with this while using.thank you Amaon.,I had purchased this phone in 10k and this phone is actually brilliant in this price range, Camera is good, fingerprint sensor is good, back panel is good (i purchased black one) , no hang but there is a small problem that battery drains little faster and when you click Home button, google assistant appears most of the time which is quite annoying sometimes, overall i am happy with the phone .,I wanted an affordable phone ; this fits the bill perfectly.,Fantastic finger reader, battery sustainability for a long time usage, and HD Quality natural photographs.

But it didn’t help at all. .It is not suitable for large phones like IPhone 11 Pro Max . . Very clumsy and the tripod doesn’t stand at all. . Keeps sliding. .Had a very difficult time to set up the selfie stick. .,Pros :1. Useful stick - stable only till half length, after that it shakes like crap2. Bluetooth Remote is given which is very very useful (infact necessary i would say)Cons :1.Useful only till half opened - after that it shakes like anything.2.Lacks a mount to mount any led flashlight for low light videos.3. BIGGEST CON : cost of 2 batteries is more than the selfie stick itself. Now as i have no money for going for a gimble , so i am using this as well as bought 2 spare batteries (costed me 500 rupees for 2 batteries). Although i must say that you can find the CR1632 - 3v battery (the one used in this one) - much cheaper than what i paid on either local ecom website or local shops.,one must have this tripod to get full family picturethe quality is upto the markand it is standing strongly with weight of phonebluetooth control is quick and clear,If you are taking photos with your family at home then it is good. But if you are a single rider and ride solo then its length is normal. You will get only half of your photo. It should be of such length that the rider can take a complete picture with his riding gears.Then it is good for the riders. My suggestion is that it should be more length.,Everything is perfect except if you pull the tripod to a long hight,Superb,Good at all.,I haven't used it much, product is good.

Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money. Really pleased with the design and shape of watch, definitely a must buy for every person .loved the colour, durability and accuracy is super \uD83D\uDC4D. just go for it.,I liked the product it has so many features like sleep tracking, sp02, Heart rate measuring, music player, temperature checker my only nitpick would be that it only have 2 games and secondly it has good wallpapers but a Ben 10 Omnitrix wallpaper would give it an even more awesome look","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":80.0,"product_name":"Fire-Boltt Phoenix Smart Watch with Bluetooth Calling 1.3\",120+ Sports Modes, 240*240 PX High Res with SpO2, Heart Rate Monitoring & IP67 Rating","discounted_price":1999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHUGCKS7YANTMDYINXQG2UDTU4JQ,AGHQ2VHXMPWZV5SV25S5N3OENXSQ,AH3GZWZM5RVOFCJCXRU7QFBAJ5NQ,AGQ2RWOECSEFEQMIGE7VTXP65OKQ,AEVUBEFT2MRH2PRVW53SJEL7H42A,AENY7L4XGCQMI627A27G3NVIBJNA,AHQISETKX3OXMZ4IX3YO7YV4UZ6Q,AGESGUTIYJQOZ7PU563DHLYSPRTQ","product_id":"B0B3RSDSZ3","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Fire-Boltt is India' No 1 Wearable Watch Brand Q122 by IDC Worldwide quarterly wearable device tracker Q122.【Bluetooth Calling Watch】- Fire-Boltt Phoenix enables you to make and receive calls directly from your watch via the built-in speaker and microphone.

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch. Within 1 month it dropped by 3k.The price qty is ok.Some features are missing which are available in Chinese make model.,Pros1. Display(super amoled)2. Battery life(24 hrs moderate usage)3. Fast charging4. 120 hz refresh rate work seamlesslyCons1. Miui(lots of unnecessary apps)2.processor(sd 695 is too old)3.main Camera not up to the markOverall I just want to say if you're looking for a phone to watch movies and series and casual gaming go for it.(pubg, cod feels fantastic in this without any lag)If looking for heavy gaming or looking for a camera phone this one is not for you brother.,Good phone need improvement in camera,This mobile has the best camera compared with other models","rating":3.9,"discount_percentage":20.0,"product_name":"Redmi Note 11 Pro + 5G (Stealth Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) | 67W Turbo Charge | 120Hz Super AMOLED Display | Additional Exchange Offers | Charger Included","discounted_price":19999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHALPOEUQFGXEZR6NQ64ZI3EIYXA,AFJEOV652OA6P6CPXI6U34PC677A,AEMQXD272M5OGFOTZDB3PBM2KSWA,AHTNHTN3WQ3NHVW27TWJLRMQDG4A,AGXGWVE46AD3MXJRAA75U5VYV4VA,AEQIOSXDNEWT7VHJIRG5AVN2L7XA,AGZV3QEQWGL37PYNL6FF2FV25Z7A,AETFDFDDPV5V47KNM2ZNBXJ3BCJQ","product_id":"B09T39K9YL","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"Superior performance with Snapdragon 695 5G.
