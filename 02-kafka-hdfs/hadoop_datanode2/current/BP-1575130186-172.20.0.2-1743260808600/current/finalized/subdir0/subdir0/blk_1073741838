Secondary, Iam a big fan of Sony and LG brands., Thirdly,as I have 4 year old kid at home I was so scared to spend money beyond 15k. Ofcourse at the first day sale for prime members when the Amazon great Indian festival started, I saw one Plus and Hisense A6H were priced at under 20k including bank offers and my favourite Sony 43inch was priced at 35k. But discarded Sony just bcz of expensive and scared if my kid whilst playing will break it. So I was continuously searching for budget friendly TVs like TCL, Redmi Nokia and Iffalcon but didn't like the 32 inch TV. Suddenly out of the blue on Thursday that is on 20 October I saw this blowing offer on Hisense Vivid 4K TV but scared to buy, but I felt offer was tempting so took the risk and bought it for 15,740/- ( deal price 20,990... ICICI Bank credit card instant discount 5,250/-) so technically bought it for 15740/- so I felt worth the risk and bought it. On 22nd October TV was delivered to me and immediately I raised installation request and technician came on 23October and installed the TV.That's my journey from searching to installation.Now coming to initial impressions.1- Picture - I'd say being a VA Panel, I can clearly see blacks are not so deep they are bit of greyish kind, however, colours are not over saturated, I felt they are normal and when I looked at TV from sides I can clearly say it doesn't come near to IPS panel display. But, yeah for an average user like me it's sufficient.2- Remote- It's simple, major apps hotkeys are given. YT, Amazon prime video, Hotstar which is good. voice assistant is enabled. Simple and user friendly experience. It lacks hands free Google assistant.3- Sound- I personally felt if 30 Watts audio given in the TV it would have been great, but only 24watts given which is crisp and clear though I increased volume upto 70 to chk, but no distortions nothing it's clear dialogues and Bass, but if a soundbar is added it will be added advantage.4- UI- It comes with Android 9 it doesn't matter to me as I'm a very average user so runs the show for me, I hope Hisense sends the OTA update5-Now to the main point as u can see my pictures, I see specially in Amazon prime video app, on the blue screen there are some lines which I don't know whether it's problem with panel or application. Need to chk with Amazon customer service for the reason. If any user can help or enlighten me on this issue that would be super.6- Conclusion - Frankly speaking i bought this TV only bcz I got it almost under 15000(bought for 17520/- including extended warranty for 2+2 years) bcz even if some mishap happens when the kids playing it won't pinch me . So from my perspective I felt it's okay with some minor issues like sound. I just need to get clarity on that prime video issue. If that is sorted I will be happy.Happy Diwali to team.,I have bought this tv at 18,990.00 and at this price tag its a great purchase.picture quality is good not at per with sony or lg 4k tv but better than its rivals like mi redmi VU etc. VA Pannel works fine and gives good amount of blacks.Pros:Android TVSoundColourCons:Remote,Loved the picture quality,Average picture quality but ok for this price,Worth for the cost. Nice quality and clarity,Good,Good product,Good support team as unit reached within 11 hours installation done within time of installer called. Demo properly given. And company call also received in 3 days for confirmation of material delivery and installation done proper way .","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":53.0,"product_name":"Hisense 108 cm (43 inches) 4K Ultra HD Smart Certified Android LED TV 43A6GE (Black)","discounted_price":20990.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFP334GQV3WBH6XJIX5VITMYOH2A,AHAIKXSSOQ7R5GBPVSBR6VE72QVQ,AHTSXQI7JAQVYVVQE6DK4B2EJSPQ,AH3DODDCISNEXGUHYV4MRDQ3H36Q,AFNNLWHF3B35C5XQN3Y6T77GIJFQ,AHN73IF2MNKIJ2MEMND5ODN7XDFA,AGG44FGU5A2RZMRCILNFIV6SCYDA,AHFQGP45QKIEFKYOCYUH4DP63XGQ","product_id":"B099K9ZX65","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Televisions|SmartTelevisions","about_product":"Resolution: 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160) | Refresh Rate: 60 Hertz|Connectivity: 3 HDMI ports to connect set top box, gaming console etc | 2 USB ports to connect hard drives and other USB devices | Bluetooth | Chromecast Built-in | 5G Wi-Fi | Stylish Voice Remote|Sound : 24 Watts Output | Dolby Atmos | Multi Channel Surround Sound for best sound experience | Powerful Sound|Smart TV Features: Official Android TV 9.0 PIE | Built-in Assistant | RAM: 2GB | ROM 16 GB | Quad Core | Search| Netflix | Prime Video | Disney+ Hotstar etc on Official Play Store|Display: Dolby Vision HDR | Ultra Dimming | UHD AI Upscaler | HDR 10, HLG support | Near Bezel-Less, Ultra Slim Design|Warranty Information: 2 Year Comprehensive Warranty on product provided by Hisense from date of purchase.|Installation: For requesting installation/wall mounting/demo of this product once delivered, please directly call Hisense Support for assistance (Please visit Hisense Website for Toll Free Numbers) and provide product's model name and seller's details mentioned on your invoice.

Serves the purpose. Had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick (bern working for 3 years) is no longer working when connected to my Samsung TVs HDMI port (all 4 ports). Searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with Samsung TVs but with no possible solution. So wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the HDMI slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. The firestick worked well with monitor. What's even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same Samsung TV using this cable. Problem solved, although no clue how the hell it got fixed :),The quality of this cable is quite good. Been using it for a couple of months now, to connect a laptop or a desktop to a Dell monitor. Picture quality for Full HD works fine along with sound output, not sure about 4K though since I don't have a 4K monitor. Price should be less than Rs. 250 which I paid, should be in the Rs. 100/- to Rs. 150/- considering the quality and other alternative products available in the brick and mortar stores.

Besides the air mouse and motion gestures everything else works absolutely fine.Also the lightweight remote and its form factor feels really nice and cozy in hands. However the buttons have no dots or rivets over its buttons which sometimes makes you forget which key you are pressing.Other than that its a great remote controller.,This product is good for work from my box TV,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XuQNA3jRL._SY88.jpg,After having my original magic remote go kaput, I was not sure if this remote would work on my 55inch LG smart TV. However, a huge relief, it works and works like a smooth operator using the keys.  No need of any set up etc. It doesn't have voice or scroll button, but I anyways was not using that feature in my original magic remote, since that consumes batteries to a great extent forcing you to change batteries every 4 days. Don't waste money buying expensive ones, go for this.,Functionally very good, and it is a good replacement for the original remote, on which the power switch had stopped working. I haven't had to use most of the other functions.,Good performance,Cheap and best alternative for your lg remote. Magic mouse option is not there but works fine with my lg tv,Works as expected. The response is little slow but that's still fine.","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":42.0,"product_name":"7SEVEN® Compatible Lg Smart Tv Remote Suitable for Any LG LED OLED LCD UHD Plasma Android Television and AKB75095303 replacement of Original Lg Tv Remote Control","discounted_price":349.0,"rating_count":284.0,"user_id":"AFQW4AC4GLYGQC4MXQWMGJM2FWRA,AGLLHPCKRL6U2U6U5XXMJ4V6ANHQ,AE5S2QIJPXDUQT54XGJVGPQJOTSA,AGBA37OJDBIONSXA6OYI5TCIQSUQ,AHZNT25EKPGFYYUQOSYG7E5M7WRQ,AHDNBCY5WEIZQ2ETHEL72TPHNGVQ,AG42FZDSEYZOQV7FJMK7BTG3Z2BQ,AE3EGIT22MVVMLV2BZBQAURWSF2Q","product_id":"B09MM6P76N","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Accessories|RemoteControls","about_product":"Best Compatible Remote Control for LG television Models are AKB75095304 AKB75095305 AKB75095306 AKB75095307 AKB75095308|Hot Keys: NETFLIX, AMAZON Prime Video, 3D, Movies, Record, Live TV|This is a manufacturer substitution.
