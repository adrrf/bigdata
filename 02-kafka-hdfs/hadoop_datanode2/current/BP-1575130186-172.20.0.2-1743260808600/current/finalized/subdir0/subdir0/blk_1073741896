Features such as SMS (surprising since this is an LTE version) and notifications (this includes watch apps such as outlook) that require internet are only synced with the watch on e it is connected to the phone VIA BLUETOOTHI did not check other features as the main reason I ordered this watch was accessibility to notifications without phone.,I have been using this since June'22. It looks good on the wrist,and has all useful features like calling,reading and replying whatsapp messages.The battery is too low though, I keep it switched off at night(I.e. never used it to track sleep), yet have to charge every couple of days. Plus it gets charged slow.,All features of the watch is good but battery backup is very poor.
