Has long charge. Phone finder,  phone camera shutter are good features. Beautiful looking watch.Cons: Not a full screen display, display is smaller than the watch. My watch is not center alligned. Limited number of watch face. Sometimes tends to call on recent number with false touch. Phone book should be a little larger than 8 numbers.,Just bought it ,so my review is basically the first impression.I will write a detailed review after few days of use. I like the style and it looks good. So far touch operation is also good,It was a awesome watch... I liked it sleep monitoring it's accurate. According to me this worth buying and I would suggest anyone who is reading this review to go ahead and buy this watch,It's good product in this range because I have one more of pebble smart watch in same price range but after using fire boltt it's better. Only one issue that not stop call ring during office or meeting time.,I liked Everything except Hearbeat and O2 Level accuracy but it's close to real levels so average in this respect. Otherwise it's a kill for the money !!! Very good overall.,The product is good as per the price charged.

So I took the risk of ordering it and it turned out to be nightmare right out of the box, as the sound output was worse than my smartphone earphones. So I went to search for best settings on amazon & other sources but in vain. Fortunately I myself in experiments found the solution and now its working just fine.First I am mentioning all the pros and cons considering the settings that I found and then listing those settings,PROS :-------1. Built quality of the complete mic and cable is good for the price given.2. Length of cable is insane (20 feet).* I personally didn't find it useful, as I use it with my smartphone which is just couple of feet below in my pockets, but for some users it can be very useful if using in rig setup with Camera.3. Has universal 3.5mm jack, which is handy.4. Its easy to use, just plug and play device, which doesn't need any sound card or external device to work.5. Has support for multiple device right from smartphones to DSLRs and computers.6. It comes with carry pouch which is very handy, since its a mess with such long cables.CONS :--------1. Biggest con is the sound quality right out of the box. Its just garbage quality and even normal ears can't bear the background noise collection, so forget about audiophiles. My normal smartphone's earphones record much better sound quality compared to this.2. Length of cable is way too much for me and I guess for many users. I think there should have being multiple option on length to choose from, as keeping 20 feet cable wrapped and hanging or in pocket while recording is not comfortable.3. It comes with a button cell for recording sound for devices other than smartphone and there's NO way to know whether the battery is dead or what's its charging level. Only way to check is by plugging it to a digital recorder or computer and test. So if you are carrying it with recorder which doesn't has playback feature or if you are in hurry and in case of dead battery to record all the sound, then only way to find that your efforts are in vain will be when you comfortably sit to edit it and trust me, its very frustrating ! I am mentioning, it as this scenario have happened with me once, hence I am very cautious about batteries now & use it with smartphones or digital recorders.4. I think price should have being couple of hundred bucks less, considering the sound quality.BEST SETTING USING AUDACITY SOFTWARE :===================================These are the settings when you record with smartphone or any other device and there are lots of background noises and you use Audacity software, which is Free !1. Open the software and open the audio file you recorded with this mic.2. Select entire audio clip and open \"Effects\" and then \" DISTORTION \"3. Start the playback of audio clip in the software, so you can listen to change in effects that you are about to make.4.Now select \" Distortion Type \" option on the top of box and select \" Soft Clipping \".* or select \" Hard Limiter \" and do the settings as it sounds suitable to you.5. Take the \"Clipping Level cursor to extreme Right end or so until you hear soft pleasant output.6. Adjust the \"Make-up Gain\" cursor little bit if needed, I keep it on 49.* Here you can select which ever type, which you feel is suitable for you.7. Now just click \" APPLY \".8. Now is Noise reduction. For that Select short section of audio which DOES NOT have your voice, but ONLY has background noises that you don't want.9. Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \"10. Click on \" Get Noise Profile\".11. Now select entire audio clip and again Open \"Effects\" and then \" Noise Reduction \".12. Finally, click on \" OK \" and that's it !Now you are good to go with soft, slightly lesser Noises and more pleasant sound output. After these steps, you can amplify the sound from same software or any other end user software.VERDICT :-----------I personally am very disappointed with the sound quality, though the audacity tweaking gets it to bearable level, but its satisfactory enough. Plus price seems slightly more on this. I wouldn't recommend these are someone looking good sound quality specially if you live in noisy environment. Buy this only if you live in very silent conditions.,It's not great or best out there for beginners but good-I use a budget mid-range phone and the boya mic is better than in built mic of phone. record it in WAV format, it's good.-You gotta use software/apps to pull the best of this, like audacity or some other editing app.-It's pretty long and that's good as you can extend the cable to a good distance say if u r connecting it to the camera on a tripod.-Overall it's decent for beginners. I see high-end phones have good recording capabilities, but if you have a budget phone, then this one is deal.,Microphone looks very well built, it supports both phones and cameras. There are some phones that does not support external mic, please check before buying as one of my phone did not support it.They claim noise cancellation, however, I did not notice major difference it also captures great amount of noise, only cancellation is because of foam padding around the microphone. I could not observe noise cancellation, at least, while recording on phone.Overall package is well bundled, wire quality is decent, however the dongle quality is excellent, even the small clip to hold the microphone feels solid.,Wire is to long but good if quality of wire is improve in future then 5 stars from me but now 4 star good sound low price 1 star - for wire quality but over all a nice product.☆☆☆☆,I think It's good for online teaching like I do...But yeah some problems like very long cable length I mean someone might need but it should be optional.... or detachable price of the Mic itself is not much anywaysI am okay with this mic for sometime... until I am sure I need quality Rode mic to upgrade...,Don't expect noice cancellation under this budget but audio recording quality is very good.,Nice product,Decent","rating":4.0,"discount_percentage":60.0,"product_name":"Boya ByM1 Auxiliary Omnidirectional Lavalier Condenser Microphone with 20ft Audio Cable (Black)","discounted_price":798.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHB43CZ4RHLJ5S6CBOWX6MEI7J4Q,AF3XMPDSQQDSRN2PG5NGPECLPRDQ,AHQF77NZIRBV6LQMO6VEC6O5FL4Q,AFIKD3VY6WOYWPMJUTELWZAXHIXQ,AH6NJEFXD5ISMZJQICGKAZPQQGWQ,AGQS2PKNNCEBXCPSYKOO4I2DGZNQ,AEMACSBSMT4WLJPLOKIWGFJLJJEQ,AH2MIHS2WTWM7R5DFWRUZVTYK7TQ","product_id":"B076B8G5D8","category":"MusicalInstruments|Microphones|Condenser","about_product":"BOYA BY-M1 is an omni directional microphone, perfect for video|Designed for Smartphones, DSLR, Camcorders ,Audio recorders, PC etc.|The microphone features an Omni pickup pattern, for full, 360-degree|Using the microphone: For Smartphone Switch off the microphone Slide the ON/OFF up to OFF/Smartphone The power is shut down.

Go for bassheads 242 if you are spending this much. They are charging more for the metal enclosure and the braided cable. The angled jack is a plus but the sound quality is so-so. Infinity zip 100 and their own bassheads 242 are way better for sound.,I would like to start by saying I'm not an audiophile, therefore my review will be less about the audio quality of the product and more about the over all experience regarding the product. First off, this is my second time buying the product and you guessed it, it's good enough that I will buy it a third time if need be!Upon unboxing we are greeted by the presence of 3 pair of extra ear buds . There is also a pair of ear fins in the packet containing the extra ear buds, these ear fins are used to keep the ear buds snugly in your ears during strenuous periods of use where there is a chance of lots of movement. More on this later.Coming to the ear phones itself, it's among the very few ear phones that genuinely feels premium in hand. It is very durable, specially the plug part that connects to your phone, many a time my ear phones stop working because the plug part malfunctions and causes problems in the functioning of the ear phones. This is not the case with these.The wire itself is made of rubber/silicon. It feels good in hand and the only thing I can think of that could be improved here is to braid the wire but so far the wire hasn't showed any form of wear and tear common with most other ear phone wires. Another thing to emphasize is that the entire cable is flat through out, this genuinely decreases the number of instances where I find myself trying to untangle the wire. This is truly one of the best features of this pair of earphones.Remember I said something about the ear phones being made completely of metal? Well it continues to the mic and the left and right splitter. Both these pieces feel very premium because of the signature cold feeling of metal against skin. I don't know about you but attention to small details like this always brings smiles to my face. It is to be noted that the mic piece is a universal single button type and hence cannot control volume, personally this problem didn't affect me much but the might be potential buyers who might find this to be a deal breaker.Mic quality is subject to individual bias therefore I can tell you my personal experience. In my opinion I feel that the quality is average, it won't blow anyone's mind but it will deliver most of the time. A common complaint I heard from most of my callers that they find it difficult to hear me when there is a significant amount of back ground noise or wind rustling in to the mic, these are common issues even with ear phones price significantly higher than the boAt BassHeads 152Finally the most important part of the review, the sound quality of the ear phones. As I said earlier I won't be going into the technical details . I am a bass lover and that is what led me to buy this pair in the first place. In my opinion I found that the Bass is indeed good but not over powering for the average consumer like how the Extra bass versions of the Sony line up of earphones trend to be. The volume gets sufficiently high and more often than not I use it at less than half it's total volume when listening to music. The clarity of the boAt BassHeads 152 are above par and easily betters even ear phones in the 2000 INR price category this is one other reason why I love this pair so much. A point to remember, as the entire covering of the ear phones is made of metal it is significantly heavier than other ear phones. This becomes a double edged sword, on the one hand the metal makes the ear phones feel very premium but it also makes it significantly heavier than other earphones made of plastic. This causes it to easily fall out of your ears if the supplied fins are not used. The find unlike the ones find in let's say the newer Bose ear phones aren't as comfortable and can hurt your ears if used over a prolonged time.Last but not the least, there are multiple color variants of the boAt BassHeads 152 including red, black and blue. I found myself opting for the black variant both the times this may be a personal opinion but I find it to be the best of the three. That said I do see most corporate consumers opting for the black as it is a neutral color. This leaves out the red, for reasons unknown the red variant is sold at a lower rate on most sites perhaps due to shortage in sales, therefore if you are short on cash and just want a great pair of ear phones then grab these while they last.Pros:1) No metal build2) Excellent wire quality and trendy3) Durable4) Above average sound qualityCons:1) Metal build in the earphones trend to make them heavy and thus falls out of your ear easily2) Supplied Fins are uncomfortable to wear over a prolonged time3) Supplied Clip piece is removable and tends to get lost easilyI hope everyone who read this found it useful and can make an educated decision to buy or not to buy the BassHeads 220. All suggestions are welcome.Thanking you, Dwarakesh,Best quality  I like boat earphone saund quality,Only disadvantage  I noticed was this can't be use in USB phones,  3.5 mm jack is provided so it can be  usedin Jack phones only .,Nice,good,I used this headphone for travel. Very lite and easy to carry in pocket. colourful. Sound quality is good. The wire is thin so i feel cautious  While taking it from bag or pocket.,Gd one! Only thing is covers/sleeves comes out easily if not gd fit. However, additional covers/sleeves are provided.","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":65.0,"product_name":"boAt Bassheads 152 in Ear Wired Earphones with Mic(Active Black)","discounted_price":449.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFYMFZN2MFKODDI25OZKLO36LCHA,AE46PAL3I6SQVZG4CQR754OYQ7RA,AFILVEY4BG7TP2XCLB7N6AGAZMFA,AHKAHUT2A5EOQTRLYEOO6W6BQSTQ,AELYRRH5SBV6UFG3GU6BFG5BR2QQ,AES5I6RABQPPMKSG73P546HHSHFQ,AHTP6VRCDVSOFKPWMXJLFWKU2VJQ,AF27PDSYD6M3T6GI6X3VMQXOGUUA","product_id":"B07KY3FNQP","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|In-Ear","about_product":"Break away from old habits through HD sound via 10mm drivers, crystal clear sound to your ears helps you execute what you have visualized perfectly, enhance your senses with the BassHeads 152.|Vibe your rhythm all day with fantastic bass heavy tunes that drown out your stress and brings back your search for the ultimate quest, it’s time to get kicking.|Communicate seamlessly with the inbuilt mic that has high sensitivity and a versatile frequency range to provide the ultimate experience; Foldable/Collapsible: Yes, Deep Bass: Yes With Microphone: Yes.|Durable and highly resistant, the braided cable adds to the nirvana with its soft feel and tangle resilient features, because wasting time is simply not an option when you’re a boAthead|Plug into convenience with the 3.5mm angled jack to begin your journey|1 year warranty from the date of purchase","review_title":"Mediocre,Best in Budget and Beast in Quality,Best quality this product,Ear phone With Jack,Nice,good,Good sound quality,Value for money!","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/BassHeads-152-ToneSecure-Braided-Earphones/dp/B07KY3FNQP/ref=sr_1_37?qid=1672902996&s=computers&sr=1-37"}

Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch \uD83D\uDE02Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don't find it good enough if I compare it with Boat's App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":76.0,"product_name":"Fire-Boltt Visionary 1.78\" AMOLED Bluetooth Calling Smartwatch with 368*448 Pixel Resolution 100+ Sports Mode, TWS Connection, Voice Assistance, SPO2 & Heart Rate Monitoring","discounted_price":3999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHQIYGWISGS2IQAQ3OM4IZHKIV4Q,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,AE4MORXG46LGABI76KRVGV5BCLMQ,AHPN4Q3AZDX3HSUYDT7MHYDIL6QQ,AGBOBQFRZDOF5XPJRLHJYOGRFKNA","product_id":"B0B3N7LR6K","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Fire-Boltt is India' No 1 Wearable Watch Brand Q122 by IDC Worldwide quarterly wearable device tracker Q122.【Bluetooth Calling Watch】- Fire-Boltt Visionary enables you to make and receive calls directly from your watch via the built-in speaker and microphone.
