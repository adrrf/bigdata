Only con is you can't silent the incoming call which is annoying sometime, hope they fix it with an update.Built quality and looks (4.5/5) - metallic built which looks premium and straps are also quite smooth and comforting. Best thing is, it also looks good over skinny wrists(poor me, with 5.6 inch wrist). Only con is you can get scratches on display so protect with it some sort of screen guard.Touch screen (5/5) - it's almost buttery smooth without any lag which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch under 2k. I bet you will not get any laggy experience ever.Accuracy (3.5/5) - SpO2 and HR has fairly decent accuracies, it gives you a rough idea of your being, so its quite reasonable for a watch under 2k. Count steps with decent accuracy as well. Sleep accuracy is also just acceptable.To sum up, you should definitely go for this watch if you've a budget, constrained under 2000 rs,,I recently purchased the Fire Bolt Phoniex watch, which is quite stylish, and the Bluetooth calling is excellent. The voice gets to the other side without any disturbance.The build quality is good over the wrists, but you can get scratches on the display, so protect it with some screen guard. You should go for this watch if you want a budget-friendly smartwatch under 2000.,It's a good watch but i have faced two problems in it the first one is there is no feature of raise to wake and the second one is there is no option to silent it when someone calls you.....i think you should purchase it if in future company add these two features...,I recently purchased the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch, and I am very happy with my purchase. The watch is quite stylish, and I get compliments every time I wear it. The watch is also quite comfortable to wear, and the strap is adjustable to fit any wrist size. The watch also has a great battery life, and I can go for days without having to charge it. The watch also has a number of features, including a step counter, heart rate monitor, and sleep tracker. All of these features are very useful and make it easy to track my activity and health. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would highly recommend the Fire Boltt Phoenix Watch to anyone who is looking for a stylish and functional watch.,This watch is absolutely stunning and great value for money.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,\uD83D\uDC4D,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I'm very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":7.0,"product_name":"MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh Lithium Polymer 18W Fast Power Delivery Charging | Input- Type C | Micro USB| Triple Output | Sandstone Black","discounted_price":2049.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AG3SQH676VN5EH4NDNGVVLML6RZQ,AFOCDYODRNB2UUBOTDLWKH76GP2A,AE2EO67O5G5BPFX5QGUUBOF22LQQ,AG2W2BFO5CKP4J66NZOAEIBQODVQ,AF7GDUMJMOA6YGT4OT7X2KWFRH4A,AF4VQ3FUD2OLAGRSLKACCEMSMJCQ,AHVGJKIR6HAOI5KIYL2BC52ROWEA,AGUJFMAHKPIMDPBVFWG3LBGVLF4Q","product_id":"B08HV83HL3","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Chargers|PowerBanks","about_product":"20000mAh Lithium Polymer battery|18W Fast Charging|Triple port output|Dual input port (Micro-USB/USB-C, Charging Time : 6.9 hours|Power Delivery|Advanced 12 Layer chip protection|Smart power management|6 months domestic warranty","review_title":"Ok product to buy,Better than any other power banks,\uD83D\uDC4D,Nice product,Performance is OK,Very Slim & easy to carry,Decent product,GOAT","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/20000mAh-Sandstone-Triple-Charging-Delivery/dp/B08HV83HL3/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1672895748&s=electronics&sr=1-6"}

According to the price range, the battery backup and screen quality of the phone are good. According to this range, the camera is also fine. If we look at the performance, then it is not useless at all, but it is okay. I did not face any problem in calling. The phone starts lagging a lot while browsing or using shopping apps. If I give my opinion then this phone is good for parents.... If you want to buy this phone, then you should compare it with Poco C31, for now there is not much difference in the price.,All is well but sim slot \uD83C\uDFB0 damage,It is a very good phone on this price range.

However, I noticed later that this is actually Android 12 Go Edition. I don't mind using it. But some features are missing (which most people might not use).  Better than Nokia c01 which has Android 11 Go Edition, and on website there is not mention of any update.

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.\uD83D\uDC4D,Battery drains like any thing.
