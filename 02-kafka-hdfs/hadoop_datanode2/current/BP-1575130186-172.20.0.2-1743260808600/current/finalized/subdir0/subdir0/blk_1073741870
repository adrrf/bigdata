Simply put it is not 20,000 divide by the battery size of your phone will be the expected cycle times. If I consider this as a measure then I would say that the battery capacity is around 15000 mah,Happy with the product,\uD83D\uDC4D,But it’s very heavy,Day by day battery life is reducing. Remaining parameters are good.,Slim & easy to carry for Travelling & very good looking, I'm very satisfied with this product overall Good, But it takes 4 to 5 hours to charge.,Very heavy. Must be about 1-1.5kg.Very quick charge. Takes ages (almost 8-10hrs) to fully charge. Charged my Samsung m53 twice once full charged.,I recently purchased the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and have been extremely impressed with its performance. I have personally tested it with laboratory equipment and have found that it has a capacity of around 19000mAh, which is very good compared to other power banks on the market.One of the things that I appreciate about the MI Power Bank 3i is that it is able to hold its charge for a long period of time. I have not had to recharge it as frequently as I have had to with other power banks.In terms of durability, the MI Power Bank 3i has held up well over time. The construction is solid and the power bank has not suffered any damage despite being carried around in my bag on a daily basis.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase of the MI Power Bank 3i 20000mAh and would highly recommend it to others. It is a reliable and high-quality power bank that delivers on its advertised capacity.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":48.0,"product_name":"MI 10000mAh 3i Lithium Polymer Power Bank Dual Input(Micro-USB and Type C) and Output Ports 18W Fast Charging (Metallic Blue)","discounted_price":1149.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AG3SQH676VN5EH4NDNGVVLML6RZQ,AFOCDYODRNB2UUBOTDLWKH76GP2A,AE2EO67O5G5BPFX5QGUUBOF22LQQ,AG2W2BFO5CKP4J66NZOAEIBQODVQ,AF7GDUMJMOA6YGT4OT7X2KWFRH4A,AF4VQ3FUD2OLAGRSLKACCEMSMJCQ,AHVGJKIR6HAOI5KIYL2BC52ROWEA,AGUJFMAHKPIMDPBVFWG3LBGVLF4Q","product_id":"B08HVJCW95","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Chargers|PowerBanks","about_product":"10000mAh Lithium Polymer battery|18W Fast Charging|Dual output and input ports|Advanced 12 Layer chip protection|Smart power management|Micro-USB and Type C input port|6 months domestic warranty","review_title":"Ok product to buy,Better than any other power banks,\uD83D\uDC4D,Nice product,Performance is OK,Very Slim & easy to carry,Decent product,GOAT","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Power-10000mAh-Metallic-Output-Charging/dp/B08HVJCW95/ref=sr_1_116?qid=1672895777&s=electronics&sr=1-116"}

Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

But this is does not catch fingerprint at allIf u pay 500 INr higher u will get the spigen ones which protects the front sensors tooHappy with my purchase and moving forward will be applying spigen screen guards for all my products,This is hands down THE BEST screen protector for iPhones. I got the iPhone 13 one and it’s excellent. So easy to install, anybody can do it! It’s so smooth and soft to touch and fits perfectly on my iPhone. Highly recommended. Maybe bit pricey but you get 2 in the box. Fingerprint free and smudge free.,Very nice product to buy.This tempered glass is easy to install no need to worry about airbubbles while installing tempered glass.it is very easy to install on any mobiles as it designed for.worth for your money.,The quality and adhesion is good. Instalation was pretty easy.What i would have liked1. Had it had a black bezel so it blends well with the phone so that no one could make out that a protective tempered glass is stuck.2. Had it also covered the front camera like the ESR protective glass does, it would have been better.3. Would have appreciated a price around 500, definitely overpriced.,Super easy to install. The screen guard got attached without any hassles and was perfect fit. The EZ fit tray works like magic.,I used this product for my iPhone 13 Pro with a peak design phone case. The quality of the screen protector is excellent and the engineering concept used for the installation is the best I’ve ever seen. They even include useful tools and guidelines to minimise the possibility of error.","rating":4.6,"discount_percentage":66.0,"product_name":"Spigen EZ Fit Tempered Glass Screen Protector Guard for iPhone 14/13/13 Pro - 2 Pack","discounted_price":999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFDITJCB5D4EOPYZKGP5RGRJFVLA,AHFCEAPRZ44PZ2EVRAJ5SBCDGSBA,AFXDLSR7SKWLB4PKF5SSF5Q27WIQ,AHHBQDFH6KWPFVI3SBXHZNTYK3XQ,AFLRNKKT3DOOAGGWGYWTKEQMGZXA,AGYKT5FSJDBCXWNU74MA2M4OGXKA,AHPYSN2CUNOSXL6BZG6G2LFLV27A,AFJXJVGLO27UBT2KSFMXD2QDKGZA","product_id":"B095RTJH1M","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Maintenance,Upkeep&Repairs|ScreenProtectors","about_product":"Compatibility ; Glass Screen Protector Compatible with iPhone 14 / 13 / 13 Pro|9H Hardness ; Tempered glass durability rated at 9H hardness to protect from everyday scratches|Case friendly ; Made case compatible with Spigen case|Oil-free ; Oleophobic coating for daily fingerprint resistance|Edge to Edge Protection ; All-around adhesive covers the screen with no lifting","review_title":"Easy to install but a bit slippery,Very good product, value for money,Expensive but for a reason,Best Screen Protector!,Best tempered glass to buy for your mobile,Clarity and adhesion is good,Perfect product,Great product and genuinely easy to install","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Spigen-Tempered-Screen-Protector-iPhone/dp/B095RTJH1M/ref=sr_1_123?qid=1672895777&s=electronics&sr=1-123"}
