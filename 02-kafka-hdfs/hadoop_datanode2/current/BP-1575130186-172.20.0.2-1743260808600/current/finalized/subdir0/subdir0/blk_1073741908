The best features once you pair your 3 different devices to this keyboard using bluetooth, switching connectivity is super fast - like you won't feel any lag in connectivity. The instructions strap helps to well understand this product. I bought at 2.6k, but I know it's price had dropped to 1.7K during Diwali Sale.Things I hate about this product -- I felt it would be light-weight but it isn't.- Buttons are rounded (but yes gives mechanical keyboard feel which is great)- For gaming, buttons are too close to each other so your hands will take sometime to adjust and also the arrow keys are slim which don't matter because as gamer you rarely use arrow keys (it's always WASD), but yes will be problematic if you play FIFA where there is extreme usage of arrow keys.So, 4/5 for overall experience.,Good portable keyboard. I can list out the pros and cons.Pros -1. Good Connectivity with Macbook pro latest OS2. Macbook keys are mapped properly as expected.3. Portable4. Simultaneous connectivity with 3 devicesCons-1. Not an ergonomic keyboard. Its flat and doesn't have any option to incline up.2. Dont have backlight keys. You can not see the keys in dark room.3. Keys are slightly hard to press, I think due to rubber dome.4. Enter key, I feel, is smaller which cant be sensed without seeing the keyboard.Overall, my purpose got fulfilled as i am able to use it with my Macbook pro after struggling with logitech R270 combo.,The keyboard is really good and it has a good built quality and the only con is that there is no indication of whether the caps lock is on or off.,Pros: easy to use, keys feels like mechanical keyboard. Can connect 3 devices. Supports Mac and windows. Place holder for mobile devices ( However, I use it to place a pen)Cons: Expensive. Very heavy ( feels like Macbook air). There is lag in connection whenever you turn on your laptop.,price is litter high,What an excellent product I got my hands on. Smooth working and connect to 3 different gadgets at the same time and u can work on any of them. Buttons are of good size so typing is easy and fast. The inbuilt holder for gadgets is really solid and helping. And it's connect to IPhone also.,Only uses for typing if horizontal view is suitable to see what we typingThink twice before buying,Not working properly on macbook pro! Switches to junk characters frequently which is really frustrating!How did I fix ?The keyboard switches to symbol/junk characters when the option key is pressed. So, I had to disable the option key in the keyboard and live with it!Apart from that above problem, It's a good looking keyboard. The keys are smooth to handle. Due to its container for tablet/phones, the product is not as compact as you might be expecting.","rating":4.4,"discount_percentage":21.0,"product_name":"Logitech K480 Wireless Multi-Device Keyboard for Windows, macOS, iPadOS, Android or Chrome OS, Bluetooth, Compact, Compatible with PC, Mac, Laptop, Smartphone, Tablet - Black","discounted_price":2595.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AH6LPYJT5UBJ7CIEWVHDCNQAGWZQ,AFG4CVSEFXYGJMIHZKX7JGGLCSZA,AFEXNZMRCU4SZFDGWRO6P4CMOGRA,AEUTWNKAMWBUEKXPNPWLZAV2PASA,AE4WVGQ3VRHKHQN3CNM7NCZL3BBA,AGQA6CD2EAQHTFTTONWV6IBD4PLQ,AHXVDMVAJ3EJF56HHLY7CHZK5ULA,AESCIZFPXLL5RG2IAYQEL5V2KNDA","product_id":"B00MUTWLW4","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Keyboards,Mice&InputDevices|Keyboards","about_product":"Type on Any Device: A new type of wireless computer keyboard for your desk that also works with your tablet and smartphone; connect with any Bluetooth-enabled device with external keyboard support.|Easy-Switch Dial: Simply turn the dial of the Logitech K480 keyboard to switch typing between 3 connected Bluetooth wireless devices, you can work with Windows, macOS, Chrome OS, Android, and iPadOS.|Familiar Keyboard Layout: Find all the shortcut keys you use the most, but in a space-saving design that lets you place your mouse close to you, for less arm reaching and better posture.|Integrated Cradle: A cradle to hold your phone or tablet at just the right angle for you to read while you type; fits most phones and tablets up to 0.4 inches thick and 10 inches wide.|Reliable Power: This portable, wireless Bluetooth keyboard comes with 2 pre-installed AAA batteries which can last up to 24 months (2) and is compatible with wired, wireless or Bluetooth mice.|Durable and Spill-resistant: The wireless and compact keyboard K480 is also spill-resistant (1) to survive small accidents; it’s a reliable and durable partner for your desk at home, or at work.|COMPATIBLE DEVICES - PC: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, 11 or later ; Mac: Mac OS X or later ; Chrome OS ; iPad or iPhone: iOS 5 or later ; Android tablet or smartphone: Android 3.2 or later.|Upgrade to Logitech K780 Keyboard: For more productivity and comfort, try the K780 keyboard with number pad for efficient data inputs, Bluetooth/USB, scooped keys, and cradle to hold your phone.","review_title":"Very very very good in terms of ergonomic,Good keyboard but have some cons,Good For Daily Use,Easy to use, hard to carry,nice,Excellent, Durable and connects to any gadgets including IPhone,Not suitable for all,Absolute Rubbish -> Moderately Good Product","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-Multi-Device-Bluetooth-Keyboard-Black/dp/B00MUTWLW4/ref=sr_1_259?qid=1672903007&s=computers&sr=1-259"}
