I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

Very useful too.,A good product.,Good value for money, bought it for 89rs. If height was 1” more would be great,It's heavy and stable.Good product but can't change as given in photo because space is very low near base.,I loved the build quality of this stand at this price point. The stability is pretty good and it holds my phone even with a thick case properly. There is only one downside. While connecting the charging cable with your phone in portrait mode, the cable bends sharply as the stand is quite low. But I place it on the box the stand came in and it works for me. So no problem for me at all. Value for money product.,Quality if the product is very good. It's been a while since I'm using this. Sturdy too.

Screen quality is good with little boosted colour tone.3. The new processor is very smooth and responsive.4. Speaker quality is good without too much treble.5. Camera is ok for selfie and main camera performance is above average with less noise.6.
