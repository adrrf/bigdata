Bought 1 more time as last cable damaged when phone fell on usb cable port as my phone is heavy and I never faced any issues so i bought one more time and didn't went for replacement as its waste of time and energy, i also have boat earphones that is also awesome..\uD83D\uDE04,Good,Charging is very slow. Forget about fast charging. Not useful at all,Cable is not fit properly on my samsung galaxy m31 type C port. If little hit happens then cable is plug it out. Otherwise length and cable quality is very nice,Boat type C cable doesn't support fast charging on Oppo F15, earlier i was using Vooc cable, which worked excellent","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":60.0,"product_name":"boAt Type C A325 Tangle-free, Sturdy Type C Cable with 3A Rapid Charging & 480mbps Data Transmission(Black)","discounted_price":199.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFB5KJR4Q5FICAHBOPDPUTB3O7QQ,AHW3QBHDOUMXODZ4EAMHD5JMDIDQ,AGXRGH7DLS3RVFS5KWU4PGR3H3GQ,AFLIHOX2HH7S2OJAD63UAHKMY34Q,AEHBE4U3HD6G2TMSHKE7TNZYOWCA,AFHKIURZM4R62UEXTOCZLI2FPQ6A,AEW6K4E5A4RUWRFFUDINQE5WWBSQ,AG4LMDCRAAKD4U2FZ6B6N75KTHXA","product_id":"B08WRBG3XW","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","about_product":"Type C A 325 Cable Is Designed With A Perfect 1.5 Meters In Length For Hassle Free Usage|It Dons Premium Braided Skin That Makes It Sturdy And Invincible Against External Damage With 10000+ Bends Lifespan The Cable Stays Stronger And Lasts Longer|Type C A 325 Offers Universal Compatibility With Smartphones, Tablets, Pc Peripherals, Bluetooth Speakers, Power Banks And All Other Devices With Type C Port|The Reversible Metallic Aluminium Tip Lets The User Connect Devices In A Carefree Manner|Its Flexible Design Offers The User A Tangle-Free Experience|2 years warranty from the date of purchase","review_title":"Good for charging and Data transfer,ਮਜ਼ਬੂਤ,Good Quality but less Power Delivery,Fantastic!,Good,Not useful,Doesn't fit properly,Can't support Oppo mobile for fast charging","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/boAt-A325-Tangle-Free-Charging-Transmission/dp/B08WRBG3XW/ref=sr_1_20?qid=1672909124&s=electronics&sr=1-20"}
