However, sound was good,Nice,Sound quality is goodBattery performance good,It is a satisfactory Bluetooth speaker and is perfect choice for those who are looking for a budget wireless speaker for their laptop or mobile phone with low volume issues or for those who need some portable music device and who dont want to shell out lot of money. It serves these purpose very well and is not pricey. Why I am saying all this……First things first, I got this at 549 (the black one only as rest of the colors were way too pricey and choice of colors can be sacrificed in such a case). 2. My laptop and phone volume  is too low and watching a video or listening to music on these devices is not a good experience. So here too this speaker served the purpose as connectivity is excellent, size of speaker is conveniently small, lightweight and battery backup is damm awesome. After a complete charge I used this speaker for continuously for about 6 hours at about 80% volume and still the speaker is left with 60% charge. I cannot comment right now for the charging time as it arrived with more than 70% charge and I just topped it to full. Bluetooth connectivity is exceptionally good upto 10 mtrs. FM reception is average without connecting the data/charging cable but it is awesome if the cable is connected. It has only four buttons and all the functions are controlled by these buttons only. First button “M” is mode which when pressed switches from Bluetooth to FM to Aux to Usb/memory card. Transition of switching is flawless. Volume up/down keys are used to change volume and switch the channels. Long press changes the volume and short press/click changes the channels in FM or changes the track via Aux. Most usefull feature of this speaker is its mic. Yes, you can actually use this speaker (when connected to phone) to talk with someone and that too with no connectivity issues. Voice clarity is very good for the calls made. MUSIC CLARITY IS NOT VERY GOOD. (READ CONS FOR THIS). Quality of the plastics used seems good and feels durable.CONS. Sound quality is just average.  Voice call clarity is very good where music is not dominant. But when it comes to music, this speaker struggles to deliver quality. People are complaining in reviews that it doesnot produce any bass, but actually its is the bass produced by the speaker which deteriorates the quality. This is understandable for this product as it just has one tiny speaker inside and if manufacturer makes it to produce some bass will definitely deteriorate the music quality. But this is manageable and you can ADJUST THE MUSIC EQUALIZERS in your laptop or phone to get pretty decent music quality. This is the reason I don’t consider its music quality a con for the product. There’s one limitation about charging connector to. It comes with a charging port compatible to A/B type connector, so if you have a charger with data cable supporting “C” type connectors, you are bound to use the charging cable supplied with speaker only. So you cannot keep just one common cable with you to charge both your phone and speaker. Instead you will have to carry two different cables. This speaker does not come with a charger, so you will have to use your mobiles charger (5v, 1A)  for the purpose. But for the price rage, this seems reasonable.Useful tip for buyers: Most of the smart phones will display battery percentage left in the speaker. But you can install any of these two apps “Bluebatt” or “Bluetooth check ringtone and show battery level” from the playstore, if in case your phone is unable to fetch battery data from speaker.What you get in complete package: 1 unit of Bluetooth speaker, 1 cable which has Aux connector, USB connector and (A/B type) micro Usb connector, 1 tiny  user manual.Quality of packaging: Excellent, sturdy,  packaging used by Cloudtail to secure the company’s product packaging. Manufacturing date was of May-2021.,I like it,Portability and Bluetooth connection is good.,Awesome \uD83D\uDE0E\uD83D\uDC4D","rating":3.9,"discount_percentage":45.0,"product_name":"Zebronics ZEB-COUNTY 3W Wireless Bluetooth Portable Speaker With Supporting Carry Handle, USB, SD Card, AUX, FM & Call Function.

I wish the comfort level was better,Expected a better product from JBL. The Bass is quite low and has some disturbance also.,Best entry level NC headset with better sound quality. NC is not that good but cancels subtle noises and turn down down other noises. People talking are not canceled, only muted down. Sound is good for the price range(4/5). If you are looking for superior NC, try to buy sony xm4s wheb there is an offer which is my next headset to buy. The cushions are far too small to fully cover ear, they kinda rests on ur ear edges which is kinda painful over long usage. There was no sweating issue since the headphone has air holes and provide air circulation to ears. Charging time was around 1 hour. Battery life is so perfect, like u can charge this full and use it for a while week without NC with around 5to6 hrs of daily usage. So final verdict is bang for the bucks. If u r into NC, just go buy xm4s... \uD83C\uDFC3,Good quality product,Very good for phone calls.The microphone is excellent.

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let’s have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today’s comfort-seeking world, who’s will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won’t have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title “SanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0” and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term “Ultra” came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5”inches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won’t give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn’t have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that’s a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn’t work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline “Ultra” and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s – write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as “Ultra-slow”.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE: Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements & Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brand's same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW: SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive (Gold):1. STORAGE SPACE: Just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS: For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So that's 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING: Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won't be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP: Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesn't take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy user-interface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones.- Features include: cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phone's File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. BEWARE - Users of Memory Zone App should know that they agree to Terms of Use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of Movies, Music, Software, Books, etc as per DMCA copyright laws then the Company will provide the user's data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.OVERALL - best product in the market, at best price in Indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,Value for money.

The only drawback is that most of the features that it offers are cloud based and requires you to pay to avail them.Features like \"rich notification\", where the phone notifications also contain a screenshot when the motion is detected, should have been included as part of free service (at least when connected to the same wifi). As of now, the only free notification that you get is an alert with the date and time the motion was detected and you need to open the app and wait for it to load up before knowing what motion had occured.AI motion detection also should have been a locally available free feature instead of relying on cloud. The normal motion detection is not very perfect and has few false positives.Also, a web UI would have been nice to have instead of relying only on the Tapo app to view and configure the settings.Overall, as a normal ip camera with recording, this is great but most features that it provides requires paid cloud connectivity which was disappointing and it lacks a web UI. Hence,I would recommend that you check other brands before deciding to buy this.,Very good for small shops or indoor for house care,It was definitely not a new sealed product. It looked like a returned product resold to me...it was dusty inside, original stickering worn out etc..  but the product works n i am ok with it.,,Tapo cam is very good and working as expected and 32gb sd card can record upto 3 days and continue in loop mode.
