Battery backup is good , camera is good and in this price range this is one of the good option as of now,The best phone in 2k22 I have purchased in 30sep but on 2dec my mobile stolen during this period I have used 7-8 hrs in a day continuesly but there's no lag problem battery life is good the speaker is not good I think in this mobile there is one problem I face,-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this.
