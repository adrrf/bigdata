And nagative side is i ordered black strap watch and i got grey strap watch and this is sellers mistake, i tried to return this and I've called Amazon help line then hear my problem and see it online that i got wrong item and then they say they will connect me to other person who will solve this and then no one pick the call the ring just continue to ring and after 5min i thought that no one is gonna pick the call ever and i disconnected and start using it. Watch have some basic futures and i like it.,One of the best product in this price range. Been using it for a year now and I have no complaints. Built quality is good. Steps count is not very accurate and we can say that the software lacks in accuracy in many ways when compared to other big brands (Apple/Fossil). But I have seen worst. Touch is very smooth and the notification alerts works as expected. This is water and swim resistant. I am not sure if it has IP67/8 rating but I believe this is dust proof as well, since I have been using it for almost a year now.Good product for this price range.,Everytime sleep mode has to activate, this should not be done.

Good for living rooms about 12x12 ft or even bigger space. I installed it and connected to TV using coaxial cable. Volume, clarity, bass, everything is perfect. Overall value for money product.Long review - I have experience other company speakers like JBL and Sony and had decided to buy those, but this one is similar in sound quality. Treble is nice and crisp. Vocals sound nice even at higher volumes. Bass is amazing - fills entire room with that BOOM sound. Watching movies and listening to music is much better now with these speakers.Used these for about 7 days and overall experience is good.-- Sound bar (not subwoofer) - Size is big considering this is 80W, but for me this is perfect size as it matches my TV length and looks good.-- Subwoofer - Small and compact unit. Bass is amazing. Gives that boom effect in action scenes and when listening to music.-- Remote - Minimal but functional remote. Has all the required features in single click.-- Connectivity - Does not have optical SPDIF but that's ok as Coaxial option is available and mostly all TVs have Coax connectivity only. Take a look below for Bluetooth connectivity. Overall Bluetooth works very well, except when you connect certain devices with newer hardware.I have a smaller unit installed in another room and always used to watch movies on that speaker unit. But after listening to this one, I feel sound, and bass of that other unit is just very low. This one really sounds good and makes watching movies and listening to music a good experience.Note: I think the unit uses Bluetooth 4. If you have devices with new BT 5.0 drivers or hardware, when you connect such newer devices, treble and sound quality has minor issue. Not much but still you can hear it in some situations that treble, and vocals are not clear. This is not an issue when you use your mobile to connect using Bluetooth. I wanted crystal clear sound, so I have connected using coaxial cable and sound quality is amazing over wired connection.,Sound quality is average not up to the mark,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61OBa98lVML._SY88.jpg,All the best but AUX mode not working,It would be good it the sound system was more better \uD83D\uDE01,Best,Nice prodect,Remote playback so best mujhe to acha laga #tag zebronic","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":60.0,"product_name":"Zebronics Zeb-JUKEBAR 3900, 80W Multimedia soundbar with subwoofer Supporting Bluetooth, HDMI(ARC), Coaxial Input, AUX, USB & Remote Control (Black)","discounted_price":4999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AGYLPG3HSE4P53V3EB3MKLQ7KLTQ,AFXKSM63UF5OAWWNXC3BB46V2E6Q,AHGZZFMXCGD7QFG2Y44DLYVDGPQA,AHNNXK6R7H6EEBQ2BZE7A4HIFWZA,AGWYUX5PXASNTNHQVVFV6P5QRFRQ,AFAD7OCCGIXRKR3RT4KLNHPJKN7Q,AGYB2YEGULFOWJP6KAAK37LUEPBQ,AGDA7CERL2POC3BWBG3FR6XKGVVQ","product_id":"B08CRRQK6Z","category":"Electronics|HomeAudio|Speakers|SoundbarSpeakers","about_product":"Zeb-Juke Bar 3900 is a soundbar that has powerful dual 5.7cm drivers and 13.3cm subwoofer to deliver a hi-fidelity cinematic experience right at your home.|The soundbar comes with multi-connectivity options like you can enjoy wireless streaming via the BT mode or choose others like USB, AUX, HDMI or coaxial input.|The soundbar comes with an LED display with volume/media controls and a fully functional remote control.|Output power (RMS)Subwoofer 40 wattsSoundbar 40 watts Total 80 watts|Driver sizeSubwoofer 13.3cm x 1Sound bar 5.7cm x 2|ImpedanceSubwoofer 6ΩSoundbar 4ΩFrequency response 55Hz-20kHz|Line input 3.5mm, Coaxial IN, HDMI (ARC)Max. supported memory size (USB) 32GBBT name ZEB-JUKE BAR 3900BT version 5.0","review_title":"Value for Money product,I didn't receive adaptor with my speakers..I'm disappointed,Sound,I can't AUX mode service,Good,Sound best Quality.,Very good,So sweet sound but subwoofer not good","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Zebronics-Zeb-JUKEBAR-3900-Multimedia-Supporting/dp/B08CRRQK6Z/ref=sr_1_366?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-366"}

Xiaomi has already released home security cameras using other brands such as Yi. And the home security camera market is yet to be adapted in large. So, you can expect a lot of misunderstanding on how everything works together in a home security camera in general.Initial setup: It is a breeze for some, but pain for others. See the 1-star ratings if you want proof. I had trouble getting this camera recognized by its own app (Mi Home). It took about 1 hour to recognize after trying with different lighting conditions. The camera got disconnected from the app, after I switched the SSID of the router. So, I had to pair it again. This time, it took more than a day(!) of trial and error. I had to keep the camera under bright sun light in order to get recognized by the Mi Home app. Lesson learned in a hard way.Bandwidth requirement: This camera requires 24x7 connectivity with solid internet connection and with good upload bandwidth. Even if you have 100mbps connection, this camera can only be connected via wireless. So, longer the distance from the router, shorter the bandwidth. This camera hangs up, if it doesn't have enough bandwidth. If you add NAS storage, you'd need even more bandwidth between the camera and the router. The camera is very sensitive. If you set up any conflicting configurations, it'd just hang and would not record anything at all, even in the on-board SD card storage. If the camera hangs for a particular reason, you have to restart it. It is a pain to troubleshoot things when you are miles away from home in another city.Mi Home app requires almost all the permissions from your phone. But, I was able to disable most permissions except location and storage. What's more! You get ads in the app right after opening it (on the dashboard where you see the list of devices) since version 5.4.43 (released on Dec 26, 2018). I wish Xiaomi released a dedicated app for home security cameras, like other companies have done.Google Assistance isn't compatible with this camera, if you are into that sort of thing. Some other cameras from Xiaomi (not released in India) are supported, though.Once paired to the app and once you have the perfect setup (with NAS and good wireless bandwidth to / from the camera), you may become addicted to use it under different conditions, such as with total darkness.If you are technically sound and have around 10k budget, Raspberry Pi based home security is a better option! If you are on a budget and if you don't want to spend a lot of time on technical things, then, Xiaomi Mi Home Security Camera is the best home monitoring camera you can get!,Good enough!

Bye☺️,achhi product he,Got the product delivered unharmed in 6 days.I got it for ₹499.This is the best branded product in this price range.Sound quality is pretty good considering the price.Bass is good but the loudness is a bit low, you have to listen them above the 50 level of your mobile.Clearity is very good.I bought them for online lectures and they worked great for the purpose.Ear cups are comfortable and reduces much background noise, besides they aren't known for passive noise cancellation.The wire attached to the ear cups is a bit delicate and may break if pulled forcefully so you have to handle it carefully.I have attached a pic with side by side comparison of my old Boat Rockerz 400 which I bought for ₹999 in 2018 and they lasted for a very long duration of 4 years.The Boult Audio Q2 looks a bit delicate as compared to Boat Rockerz, but don't forget there's a double price difference between them.Let's see how long it goes....Summing up this is the best product in this price segment (₹500). Just go for it if you get the same.,Noise level is so high I couldn't listen more than 5 minutes..

There was a little difficulty faces as guide frame supplied is not 100% according to glass but some how i fixed it successfully. And thanks to seller for supply a pair of screen guard. Packaging was also good.,It's really of good quality, I have read problems like the apple pencil doesn't work after applying this protector but I honestly didn't feel any lag. I rated 4 because one of the protectors created a bubble at a specific area and didn't get out even after trying so hard and following all the instructions properly, and I had to use another one which got applied properly without creating any bubbles,\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB✅,I ended up wasting one tempered glass because of air bubbles that wouldn’t go away. I skipped wiping with micro fibre cloth which may have led to the problem. However the other glass worked fine, I had to take off my iPad cover to enable the application, the previous one wouldn’t align with the cover in place. Adhesion of the first one gave up as soon as I tried to lift and reapply, again might be attributable to the fact that I didn’t get rid of the dust particles like I should have.The one that I successfully applied, works just fine.,Good product. Decent alignment.,great product, theres no such anti glare thing, also not really good for using apple pencil, i mean the surface is not paper like thats why, one more thing it gets fingerprints really fast…application is very easy but take care there is no dust on the ipad because if a bubble’s formed you CANNOT correct it,Good,","rating":4.5,"discount_percentage":23.0,"product_name":"ESR Screen Protector Compatible with iPad Pro 11 Inch (2022/2021/2020/2018) and iPad Air 5/4 (2022/2020, 10.9 Inch), Tempered-Glass Film with Alignment Frame, Scratch Resistant, HD Clarity, 2 Pack","discounted_price":1234.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AG5AXAJDBTPTEASP2CGYURERHSQQ,AEUQXSX3YSNN5L37W7I243ABWXHQ,AH2OLX25TOPFVMWSSXCIDK2ING3Q,AHSLJYCXIB6MF7XA745OIGQ5VY4Q,AG2XZP6Z52IRYUCU6GLGEUTP5HJA,AHGD2EMY5M3BGX5MUH5DMSV4BNRQ,AGK4RKTLQUZ5OQYSGOAI72QBN6PA,AESFHQDDCGPTVOTQQTTNA3IRSN4Q","product_id":"B07TMCXRFV","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|TabletAccessories|ScreenProtectors","about_product":"Compatibility: compatible with iPad Pro 11 inch (2022/2021/2020/2018), iPad Air 5 (2022, 10.9 inch), and iPad Air 4 (2020, 10.9 inch)|Powerful Protection: premium glass, tempered to the highest hardness rating, defends your screen against cracks and scratches from keys and other hard objects to keep it looking like new|Clear and Responsive: only 0.3 mm thick and ultra-transparent to ensure your touchscreen stays responsive and display remains flawless; full Face ID and Pencil support|Bubble-Free Application: alignment frame and cleaning kit ensure quick and easy bubble-free application every time|What’s Included: 2 tempered-glass screen protectors, instruction manual, alignment frame, and 2 cleaning kits","review_title":"Good product, set quickly on screen.,Go for it,Quality is Awesome,Seems okay,Good product,fingerprint magnet, great value for money though,Good,Simple to install and you get 2 of them, making it affordable price","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/ESR-iPad-Screen-Protector-Scratch-Resistant/dp/B07TMCXRFV/ref=sr_1_372?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-372"}

Some of the dislikes I've mentioned earlier in my review are no more dislikes. I said the sound is more or less on a flatter side but I'm quite used to it and \"I'm loving it\".. :) the Second point is I said if you are an audiophile then you may not like it but I was wrong. You might ask why... Here is why:After a long gap, I visited my Father who is an audiophile. He has numerous high-end headphones but unfortunately, he got the attention of my headphone and he just wanted to try it. I said yes (I regret it :( ) he paired it with his device and played a song. Boy!! you got to see the grin on his face :D. He said I'm keeping it you buy another one. Poor me was forced to buy another one. A few days back I got another one :(One thing I noticed in two of my purchase isTHE AUDIO CABLE IS NO GOOD. Both my audio cable had the same issue.----------------------------------------------------------------------------So the moral of the story is: Hide it from your audiophile Dad or brother.. they will unceremoniously snatch it from you.Jokes apart, people, you can't go wrong with this purchase. It's worth every square inch.Happy Shopping...END OF UPDATE---------------------------------------------------I got this product 3 days back, and I got it for Rs. 1299( lightning deal of course) This is an honest unbiased review keeping in mind the price of the product:Three days might not be a sufficient time to review this product but sorry I can't help the excitement...----------------------------------------------------Likes:1> Good built quality-------  4/5It is sturdy, for the price the build quality is great. It is not flimsy. The ear cushions are good enough.------------------------------------------------------2> Sound quality------3.5/5If you are an audiophile this is not for you. Bass is decent nothing to go overboard( as noticed in other reviews). Bass is deep enough for the price.---------------------------------------------------------3> Connectivity: pairing is easy connects like a breeze.------ 4/5----------------------------------------------------------4> Dual Mode- Wired and wireless: Boat rockerz 400 comes with an aux cable.If you run out of charge you could always connect the aux cable and use it as a wired headphone. ( I couldn't find a substantial difference in the quality of music between wired and wireless though :) ) I absolutely loved this feature. ------5/5-----------------------------------------------------------Battery backup: I'm impressed with the battery backup of this beast. I've been using it for 3 days for 2-3 hrs a day still its running. So i guess the 8 hr backup per charge is not a marketing gimmick I presume it's true. So far so good. will update it after a month's usage.------------------------------------------------------------Dislikes:1> Sound quality is more on the flatter side. When you compare it with budget wired headphones like Sennheiser CX 180 Street II bass is not too deep. You won't get that ambiance. Boat's website says:\"Don't just be loud, be loud and clear\", Nope... sorry I've to disappoint you on this. When it's loud it's not at all clear. A lot of distortions are there when you are loud.-----------------------------------------------------------2> Comfort: Believe me, it's not at all comfortable for prolonged usage. Your ear will beg you to take it off after 30-45 mins.. If you have high fortitude you can push it till 1-1.20 hrs... If you could go more than that without taking it off for a minute then you are superhuman...-----------------------------------------------------------3> Range: Boats says 10 meters range... In my experience, if you go beyond 5-6 meters then the voice will break. You will never ever get 10 mtrs range trust me on that. And I'm experiencing occasional breaks in the streaming nothing intrusive so far but I don't know whether it will be a problem down the line. Will let you guys know about it later if it's a problem.------------------------------------------------------------- 4>Flimsy aux cable: I can't complain too much about the aux cable keeping the price in mind. Remember I paid only 1299 for it. But with certain devices, the aux was not working properly. Mi note 3 had issues, Mi 4 also had issues with aux. Not sure whether it's the problem with my device. But it worked flawlessly on my laptop.--------------------------------------------------------------5> Wafer thin service centers: Boat gives 1 yr warranty but what good is it if you can't find any service centers near you. This is a hit or miss guys...---------------------------------------------------------------6> Voice cancellation: I didn't find this effective. Maybe it's just me, not sure.----------------------------------------------------------------7> Microphone is pretty much useless. You can't make calls with this headset.-------------------------------------------------------------------Some alternatives:( These are all wired headphones, comparing them with a wireless may not be a good idea but still, I compare it with them because Boat rockerz comes with an aux cable, and if you are looking for an alternative irrespective of wired or wireless it might be of some use to you)1>Sennheiser CX 180 Street II : I don't think Boat can beat this one's quality. The sound is incomparable- the base is deep, nice fidelity, nice ambiance and for a price of 799 this is unbeatable budget wired in-ear headphone. I own 2 of this beauty. Total value for money. If you are an audiophile and are on a  tight budget then I can't a better alternative than this.2> SoundMagic E10C In-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black/Gold): This is another TVFM earphone3>Sony Extra Bass MDR-XB250 On-Ear Headphones--------------------------------------------------------------------Don't buy it:1> If you are an audiophile ( obviously audiophiles will go only for wired headphones :D )2> If you intend to use it for long hours.----------------------------------------------------------------------Buy it:1> If you are looking for a budget wireless headphone with decent built quality and performance.2> If you require a wired and wireless package in one..-----------------------------------------------------------------------Verdict: I'd give this headphone a score of 3.75/ 5If you are on a budget and you want to enjoy a hassle-free Bluetooth headphone with good performance then CLOSE YOUR EYES AND BUY THIS BEAST trust me you won't regret it you won't be disappointed. In this price range, I couldn't find any other headphone with such a performance. We don't have many options.... Do we?  :P :PThe actual price is Rs. 2999 and Amazon claim they are giving 57% discount. pls don't fall for that. I would not recommend paying more than 1700 rupees for this headphone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Note: I'm not an expert in this field. This is just a lay man's review.Thank you for reading the review and I hope this will help you with your purchase decision..,My boat wired in ears were giving out after hard use and i wanted a new pair of headphones and i wanted them to be over the head types like this one. I also wanted one with both aux and bluetooth options since i would be using it for the TV, Laptop and my phone. I have fumbled with this strata of the headphone market previously and after buying good for nothing ones from motorola, i chanced upon this.Value for moneyGood bassNice sound qualityGood build, but not premiumIf you can get it below 1000 rs, then it is a very good deal,its difficult to let go of  my boat headphones , i bought this on 2019 for a 1k price on sale , the bluetooth was working fine but it went off after an year , i know this would happen , and thats when the legendary aux cable comes in , ive been using it with the aux cable for almost 2 years again , but later the top headphone band broke off , i used a fevistick to stick it up , and used it , i stretched it even further but it broke again , but there is no difference in soundquality what so ever so far , its been a soldi 3 years since usage of this product , still trying to stretch it further , if it doesnt work , i may hvae to say good by to this beast of a product , and its sad to note that the current boat products on offer fail to deliver this robust quality , they've become the company that focuses on quantity over quality nowadays , evolutions aside , i gotta respect this product for what it has given me so far .,I genuinely reviewed after 2 years and it's still working but once head strip was broke i fixed it by using YouTube video overall it's very good purchase for me.,Don’t think about specs you can blindly buy because it worth it,I recently purchased the boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth headphones. They have great sound quality and the soft padded ear cushions are very comfortable. The battery life is also impressive, with up to 8 hours of playback. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of Bluetooth headphones.,Under 1300 rs it is best head phone.... sound quality super, bass good, noise cancelation not bad, product weight not heavy.,Nice headphone, nhi,bole to jhakas\uD83D\uDE1CSound quality is very good and bass is also  good but I was expecting more like theatre bass but not like that, hhh laalach karna buri chijh h\uD83E\uDD29\uD83E\uDD29, hum sudhrenge nhi kabhi\uD83D\uDE02\uD83D\uDE02I think u r bored sum of this headphone  mast hai\uD83D\uDE02\uD83D\uDE02 enjoying,Good quality, easily connected my lg 4k smart tv","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":53.0,"product_name":"boAt Rockerz 400 Bluetooth On Ear Headphones With Mic With Upto 8 Hours Playback & Soft Padded Ear Cushions(Grey/Green)","discounted_price":1399.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFWOX5BA5QS5TCVTNV3EHQXOSCLQ,AGGM4C652EG6WSDEOWBQCR7UXG7Q,AFZ3S6RJS6RVOXVK5OAIT4AX76UA,AFRUXOMHPM4OTISKC4VE3PM45DTQ,AFGX776XSUUA2LIYKLHSXN3PHOXA,AF6XZI4LVIVFP2UTPNVFYGF7JPQQ,AGYX7IY6ZHCU2J6DXRW5SN6LGEVA,AHA3ODJCWS52ZKJYWV2UBFR3AVBA","product_id":"B01FSYQ2A4","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|On-Ear","about_product":"With 40mm Drivers get ready to immerse in HD auditory experience with super extra bass to get the day going.
