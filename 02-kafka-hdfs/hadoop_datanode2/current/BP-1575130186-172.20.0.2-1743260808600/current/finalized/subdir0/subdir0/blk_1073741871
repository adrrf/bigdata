Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . So I think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,Above average performanceNo heating issueFastest fingerprint reader&face unloakGood battery lifeOk camera qualityLight weight,comfortable on hand,All the features of this mobile was good.no doubtly anyone can buy this but nor for games.withinh the budget only it was available for me.,Dual tone flash light is not working i think it's only single led light,Two things missing1.

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

The kit has all that is required to install the protector.It does not affect the touch or the front camera, but at times fingerprint marks are often seen on it.,The installer is so precisely made to fit the phone to attach the cover on to the screen. Not tedious at all, easy, systematic and value for money. I will only buy this screen cover from now. No issue of getting dust under the screen guard. Plus two in the pack, total value for money especially when I do not have to spend a lot of time and energy on installing a screen guard.,The screen guard is very easy to install. Spigen is time tested brand. You get everything in the pack for easy installing. There is a video available as and it's very simple process as well.,Follow the steps mentioned in the included document and you should be done with installing this without issues in under 5 minutes.Works well with other spigen cases. Doesn't seem to even touch the case edges.Cost wise, you could get something cheaper, but I chose this due to the brand.Plastic waste is really high. And each protector comes with a heavy plastic template. Mother earth, please forgive me :<,This is the best tempered glass for iphone 14 pro max. It’s so smooth that it almost feels like you’re touching the phone screen. The installation process is very easy. It’s truly a value for money product.,This is a very good tempered glass which covers end to end of the screen.,If you want a high quality tempered go for it.
