Thank you.,Good product,Product looks good but Boiling milk in this kettle burns the base of the kettle it becomes full black and brown ,And eggs don't get boiled in a single go .,Nice product,After 2 months of usage, some issues have come up. Once it gets to the boiling point, it should automatically switch off but it keeps on bubbling till it is switched off manually. Next is that the water vapors and heat can be felt through the kettle on/off switch which I believe is dangerous.

It is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. Using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. I used it on 2-3 clothes and am very happy with the result. Let me describe the pros and cons:Pros:1. Very easy to use2. Removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleanCons:1. The process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. The plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the BIGGEST PROBLEM is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint-free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however, you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.Thanks,product is good overall, working fine but the seller should pack it more carefully as i received the upper detachable part in a broken condition as it is  non replaceable makes it more difficult for the customer,but coming to the working part the product quality is good, wotks fina and removes everything easily.a must buy product for winter.,I have used a similar product earlier but this one works better and size is also very effective, using is very ergonomic and like I said, does the job well. Come with a small brush to bruah off samll residue on the fabric. Would recommend buying this. Delivery and packaging was good too.,Easy to clean easy to use. Does the job. Received the product fast and in perfect condition. There is a leaflet inside promising 6month warranty. If it provides that it's teh perfect product for this price.,This is very product it cleans all lint from my woolen clothes but it have 1dislike store area is very less and slim it have problem for cleaning store area and the product is very good,This is very good. Life save in winters to remove lint from your costly winter wear. I have used it on some heavy lint area in my inner wear and it’s really removed the lints and now I can wear my inner again.,product is so satisfying and easy to use that a child can remove lint from his clothes. product overall is satisfying expect the the compartment where lint get consolidated it gets loose in every movement,Product is good and solve the lint problem very effectively so go for it","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":50.0,"product_name":"SHOPTOSHOP Electric Lint Remover, Best Lint Shaver for Clothes,Lint Remover for Woolen Clothes ,Lint Remover for Sweaters","discounted_price":499.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AGTBYZOGBXCBMYG2AN7LT4WYRZRQ,AFDWZMVLTXWWCX2UZVGVO5JLXCYA,AFXVKJMZW54XSXP6CQHUWEDPUDEA,AG4W4DLB7L3TFL5MDB7P465HOLDA,AGVEAOLFUM3KCYMH2CDHGD2NKGVA,AENJD2WI3N6QPTI4MTSQ5JABLCHQ,AFDV7XXJCNSWA3R466A2OB6WX66Q,AE4WFHYQM5DHVK4TJMYABWXRPMHA","product_id":"B01NCVJMKX","category":"Home&Kitchen|Kitchen&HomeAppliances|Vacuum,Cleaning&Ironing|Irons,Steamers&Accessories|LintShavers","about_product":"Smoothly takes off the lint from fabric suitable for sweaters, woollens, blanket .

This one is cheap quality but great for the price.Please note that there's a burning smell for quite a few uses. Also, if you grind for more than 10-15 seconds, it tends to 'trip'. Then you have to let it cool down and push the red button at the base to restart it.You can easily make dosa batter, chutneys etc. Just soak the rice and urad dal overnight since it's not very sturdy.","rating":4.0,"discount_percentage":48.0,"product_name":"Croma 500W Mixer Grinder with 3 Stainless Steel Leak-proof Jars, 3 speed & Pulse function, 2 years warranty (CRAK4184, White & Purple)","discounted_price":1290.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AGEWFIJDNQ73TIDHQIEMY6PTF7SQ,AGWAYDRCPJOSWY4HN36O4426WURQ,AG3JTK7QUAB6PSV7ECWRFCZCWNYQ,AETCTQA5AB7VTMMOTMZW2HNO264Q,AGBSGY5FA7YYUAR7KJTBGDEZ6TXA,AFIUVXNEPQTVOPLMJ5462QTEWXRQ,AHMTTSRZB6U63UH4TW6J63UXIYEQ,AEFHQZEKUBGETK53T6ASRZZROQRQ","product_id":"B08KDBLMQP","category":"Home&Kitchen|Kitchen&HomeAppliances|SmallKitchenAppliances|MixerGrinders","about_product":"Powerful Motor - 500W motor for best grinding experience even with tough ingredients like black whole gram (dal) for preparing tasty vadas and dosas; Power requirement: 230VAC, 50Hz|Specialized stainless steel blades helps you to cut even the toughest ingredients and gives the finest paste and purees for daily cooking of chutneys, dips, masalas and pastes; Motor overload protection for safety|3 detachable stainless steel jars with polished blades for fine grinding (Wet & Dry Grinding Jar (0.5 Liters), Liquidizing & Blending Jar (1 Liters), Chutney Jar (0.3 Liters)) and The jars are leak-proof for spill-free grinding experience; Jar Material: Stainless Steel ; Blade Material : Stainless Steel ; Body Material: ABS body|This product does not require installation.

Sufficient for bucket bathing and the good part is heating indication. One thing is missing in the geyser is Temp control, but overall Best in this price range (3 ltrs).,The product was delivered on time and as promised by Amazon.Upon receiving the water heater, I received a text from Havells for the installation of the product. The installation process was smooth apart from the fact that one needs to purchase a 16A three-pin socket (wall plug not included with the water heater). There are no installation charges and my only gripe with the water heater is no plug!!The water heats up very quickly (5 mins approx.) and retains temperature for good 4 hours. Light indicators show heat stages (Heating or Heated) Even though one will find many alternatives at better prices additional costs for installation and accessories should be taken into account.Bonus marks for getting the design correct.,It's compact yet efficient. Does its job well. I expected a bit quicker heating though. Installation guy came the very next day. All the accessories required was provided in the package.,But light is not working not within 2 weeks,Easy to install. Value for money.,Its a good product in terms of usability, easy to useAll in all its a great Instant geyser product with this price range. Installation was easy and it’s meets our expectations I would recommend this product to purchase.,Easy installation. Purchased for kitchen.
