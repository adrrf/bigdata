Hence, appreciate it.Packaging: Not Good. The box was tempered, torn and damaged.Product: Ordered Black, received brown. Didn’t replace as the Color didn’t much mattered. Issue is with the seller though.Performance: The pen of good. Robust, feels cheap however, looking at the price not to complain. Writes smooth.For anyone who wants to enter into fountain pens, can start with this as it does the job.Edited: Have been using this pen for over 3 days now, I am facing issue of nib dryness. If I don’t use the pen for sometime. The pen doesn’t write at all. I have to wet the nib or do something or the other in order to make it start writing. It writes great when it starts writing. But the initial pick up is really bad. I have a platinum preppy too. It’s a better option to go with if the budget is tight. However, there we have good writing but bad looks.,Few points I have been reading about this pen which I would like to answer. (Compared with two other pens- Parker Vector and Luxor V5)1. Grip  Read in couple of reviews regarding the thick grip and the \"curve\" at the grip which makes it awkward to hold. Honestly, have not felt so at all. The grip is pretty medium, larger than Parker Vector and comparable to the Luxor V5. It wont create any problems holding it. I am an average 5'10 and people of same build, hand and finger size wont be any problem. Also on Parker Vector the metal body starts to feel slippery due to metal, small grip and feels tiresome after writing couple of pages. Been nice to hold the Elegante and feel firm in hand, it makes one feel like holding a pen with substance :) .2. Nib and feeder:  It says Fine on the nib and it is comparable to the Luxor V5 0.5 and Parker Fine nib. Few claim it is 0.7 / medium kinds. Its all about the pressure on puts when writing it. I just touch the nib on paper and rest the pen does, so would say- it is Fine. It is way too smoooooother and fluent than Parker which felt a bit rough. Parker Fine nibs give a feedback making it bit of a dragging experience. However on Elegante the nib just flows and slides over the paper. It is not only the nib but also the feeder which ensures the nib slides. The feeder ensures that there is even flow of ink through out the writing experience. The writing it leaves is slightly wet and not dry, personally i prefer that over the dry and dragging. This ensures that one gets to write about 6 pages i.e 12 sides without a refill.3.  Plastic construction and feel in hand:  The cap is made of brass(as they say). The cap has a \"matte\" finish, not a glossy one. The clip and top is glossy. Gives a fair enough good contrast to add some \"looks\" to it when taking it out of the pocket :D . The pen itself- very much plastic. If I try to weigh both the cap and pen separately, roughly they feel of same weight, it is that light weight ( just a feel factor how I felt). However this does not mean it is a cheap construction. It has fallen from 2 floors down and did not crack anywhere, so would say its good strong plastic. It makes one feel pretty solid holding it. The size if compared to other two is larger. It rests pretty well in between my thumb and index finger(which parker does not, Luxor does) , hence never needed to put the clip on the rear. Without the clip it is very much balanced (Parker and Luxor both feel well balanced without the cap placed on top) , with clip Elegante and Parker feel a bit -top heavy.4. Ink filling:  Personally always been a fan of eyedroppers(good old school days) , however this comes with the standard piston filling( as seen in the photo by Hari). When I immersed the nib in the pen and pulled the piston it just filled half. Had to dip the whole nib till the grip when it got filled. In parker just dipping the top nib was sufficient. For Luxor pulling the whole top part out and then refuel it seemed very tedious. Some other reviews I read people have tried removing the piston converter and used it as eyedropper!!! Few said it worked , few said it leaked. Need to substantiate it. Not sure and hence wont try this out to spoil such a nice piece. If anyone has tried would love to hear your experience.5. Writing after 3 weeks:  For Luxor, it works immediately! Even after 6 months it worked like magic. For Parker bit of dipping, or couple of splashing out and it starts. For Elegante it did not start immediately. From school days used to have an Airmail (unfortunately misplaced it when i shifted) it used to work like a beauty even after 3 weeks. Elegante on this aspect did not fair so well. However, how many of us are not going to use their Pen for 3 weeks, always something to write, sign or pen down :) . It worked fairly after a break of one week.6. Colour:  Personally the \"looks\" of a pen hardly matter to me. Its the balance in hand and the nib which are the real heart and soul. We pay crazy on high class pens just for the looks. For few people this matters more- individual choice and nothing against it.  Parker gives a good classy look, Luxor makes one feel more of a student than a person with authority or executive. Elegante would be a mix of both and middle of both. Neither a college going look nor an Executive look. On looks it does fair enough justice- The cap and two metal rings is all that makes it stand apart. Would have loved if they would have made more colours than Maroon, Black and Blue. Nonetheless these colours are the royal colours and pretty good than what Reynolds have- bright designs which are more for school going kids to attract them. This does enough for me.7. Spare Nibs and feeder:  Not sure if there are spare nibs available online. I am at a location which is 100s of km away from any civilization in a jungle or a desert and only way is to order online (thankfully speed post delivers faster than couriers :lticaptd: ) . After using this nib, I would personally not place any other nib. I am pretty happy about it. (always good habit to have spare nibs, dont know when one drops it and needs to change).8. Recommended for:  Its a must for student. At this price range where one is still studying and not earning, this sounds a good buy, though not the best as Luxor beats this is VFM. Parker, would never recommend it for students. If someone wants to carry it for exams- carry 2 atleast, all due to the limited piston converter capacity. Luxor- would be best. If you are an executive sitting in a board of meetings where you want to make a statement by what you carry then there are many other alternatives. This is fair on looks and pleasure for writing :)  :)  :) .9. Value for Money:  For a standard person like me or a student, Luxor beats Elegante and Parker. However for a fountain pen- This is an excellent VFM :)Well, this sums up my experience after using it. Anyone has anything more to add to this or share their side we all would love to hear it,★ First of all, it came in a really bad condition. The package was almost flattened. All thanks to the people connected with the transition and delivery. Thank God it doesn't have any dent.★ Secondly, it is probably a used product. Because it came with the smell of ink in it out of the box.★ Thirdly, the brand claims that it is having a fine nib, but probably according to the European standards. I am a Pilot lover, so I know what fine nib is. This is medium sized nib at its best according to the standards of Pilot. Using a pen with fine nib is like having a perfect orgasm. You remember the experience for a long time. The handwriting also becomes better. That's lacking in this pen.* Thankfully it doesn't squirt ink every now and then like most of the other cheap fountain pens. I had two Wingsungs. Those were unbearably squirty.★ Fourthly, the grip is average.★ Fifthly, if you are a beginner, you may go for it, as it will obviously let you get used to the fountain pens. You may use it as a day to day pen.BUT DON'T STICK WITH THIS ONE ONLY. EXPLORE THE WORLD OF PILOT IF YOU HAVE THE BUDGET. TRUST ME, YOU WON'T LOOK BACK TO A PEN LIKE THIS. I WAS GIFTED A PILOT CROCODILE FINE NIB BY MY MOM. I WANT TO KEEP MY MEMORIES WITH THIS PEN SAFE. SO I DON'T USUALLY USE THAT. THAT'S WHY I'VE BOUGHT THIS ONE.★ Lastly and most importantly, a suggestion to the buyers, to make your pen experience ergonomic, please don't put the cap on the backside. Open the cap, keep it aside and unleash your writing...,very nice pen., it's really amazing very smooth writing.thank you seller & amazon.,Its not for speedy writing, if you are use for signature its cutting off character,...., Some time spread over ink. And some time character cutting.... Cheap plastic product but at a 200 good for beginners.,I've been using this pen for about 3monthspros:Build quality for this price is amazinggold Nib looks amazingcons:Nib comes out easily,Just that the neck area of the pen was little broad for me to get used to ..,Guys I have started using fountain pens again a few months back. I had used all types of fountain pens during my school days like COLLEGE brand eye droppers, Camlin, Parker (made in USA), Hero (China made). Recently I am using Platinum Preppy which is very smooth and excellent pen and yes expected since it is Japan made. This the Camlin Elegante is our very own Made in India pen. It makes us proud. Just superb pen. Very smooth. It is actually a no nonsense pen. Only thing...since I had read a few negative reviews about this...I am using it with PILOT BLUE ink. I don't know whether ink quality is further improving its performance or what?

Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn't know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.< Information on the number of color and black-and-white sheets from the initial set of cartridges to be added when I run out>,good scanner & printer,Installation procedure is very simple and priter quality is high. I had a Xerox copier, but istallation of scanner option could not complete.,If you are purchasing it for your home use, don't look any further. It has got all the functions you'll find in a 20-30k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I'll have to purchase a larger cartridge.,Very good printer. Sometimes back to back printing cases paper blockage. But overall very happy,gud printer but printing cost is expensive. in this price range features are very nice.,I got this printer ion 02Nov2022, After 15days of usage ..I'm unable to print as it is showing Color & black ink is low ..i have print less than 50pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield which is totally wrong.,Cannon E4570.This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn't have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues.","rating":3.8,"discount_percentage":13.0,"product_name":"Canon E4570 All-in-One Wi-Fi Ink Efficient Colour Printer with FAX/ADF/Duplex Printing (Black)- Smart Speaker Compatible, Standard","discounted_price":8349.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFXXFWMGUKQDP27JRILRUKME7R4Q,AE6JO5FOQR3D3UE4GTIJT5FVRNKA,AHT5FELZRNJ4ITAESWGATN2COH3A,AECMC4ZTLI2FFUQHAXVILRVCNJHA,AGIPLO4AJSNUVZ3ASVSHC2BZXFFQ,AH2KQR23MJYSJCXDH3J6AUCON5FA,AES2TTA7I6H32D6TO6IGDCI7DFOA,AH33GQ3GIETSNVJGQPQOFZIQBR5Q","product_id":"B09F5Z694W","category":"Computers&Accessories|Printers,Inks&Accessories|Printers|InkjetPrinters","about_product":"Printer Type- Ink Efficient, Functionality - All-in-One (Print, Scan, Copy, Fax); Printer Output - Color; Connectivity - Wi-Fi, Wi-fi Direct, USB, Canon Selphy App; Scanner Resolution - 600 x 1200dpi; Apple Airprint - Yes|OS Compatibility - Windows 10 / 8.1 / 7 SP1 (operation can only be guaranteed on a PC with a pre-installed Windows 7 or later) macOS v10.13.6 ~ 11.0 Chrome OS; Duplex - Auto; Enlarge/reduce option - No; Mobile connectivity - Yes|Maximum Print Speed (color) - 4.4 ppm, Maximum Print Speed (Monochrome) - 8.8 ppm; Print cost Monochrome - 1.8; Print cost color - 4.5; Maximum Print Resolution - 4800 X 1200 dpi|Max paper thickness -64 to 275 GSM; Smart Speaker compatible; Power wattage of printer - OFF: 0.3W, Standby (scanning lamp is off) (USB connection to PC): 0.8 W, Copying (USB connection to PC): 7W|Ideal usage - Home and Small Office, Regular usage (200 prints per month); Included Components - Printer, Power cord, 1set of PG47 & CL57s ink cartridge, user manual, installation CD, USB cable|Print yield is based on the consumption data from the succeeding ink cartridge and not the first ink cartridge.
