My PC started to run as smoothly as I could have ever imagined. Although I am not a gamer but can differentiate the performance of my experience. One who wants to try out the SSD should have this one as the perfect choice,Confusing which one buying but after buying this one is best and speed up my pc. Packaging like no value for money box is band from corner,I found the start-up of the SSD slower , like if u turn on a pc the first thing that kicks in motherboard then GPU/ cup and right after that the SSD in this case i found the SSD took about 2 seconds and a delayed response to startup ,but when ever it didn't start it was quick , don't know probably an issue with my psu or something,Hands down, Go for it.Quite nice, sleek design.Build material is plastic.But one thing I found odd is that the HDD cover that when I put on it and when applied screws then the screws was very hard to put. Last holes were a little misaligned. But after a little bit of force it fits.,Bought this product in Nov 2022. Easy to install and the performance is good.,I installed into my 12yr old desktop, now my i3-540 is showing it's level best. Compared to my old HDD, it's superb to use.Go for it without any second thought.One suggestion, if just buying to boost performance and for desktop, go for 240GB version to keep the OS and keep the existing HDD as well attached as extended internal drive.,Used to upgrade the speed and performance of my old laptop. Works as expected,At first i would like to suggest to look for the rating of the seller selling electronic products, before ordering this i ordered a similiar product crucial ssd500gb but instead i got a toshiba hdd of 500 gb that too loaded with photo and word document of some guy. I contacted amazon and they refunded me right away. Then i placed this order after searching for rating of this seller, which i found legit.. The SSD is good, i installed it in my asus laptop, the laptop is running with 10gigs of ram, i3 gen8 processor, and this ssd, after installing it boot up within 20-30seconds, whereas my previous hdd takes nearly about 3-5minutes.","rating":4.5,"discount_percentage":41.0,"product_name":"Crucial BX500 240GB 3D NAND SATA 6.35 cm (2.5-inch) SSD (CT240BX500SSD1)","discounted_price":1815.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AGHW3JDEF6JIRC4HB43UDMKOFXZQ,AF4N3Q6OEXVBSAHPK5NVJRGEZT5Q,AGM7YFUBLKUQPYVYZQDDPI3RXSZA,AHECHFXUUNHLH3RQ6ESN5GCUHGPQ,AGGTMAPT4WBWP2C62I6CGW22QNCA,AH42ECAG6LPCU22T5BYN5OXQO74A,AEYY76T7GEFE75ZEMXWPKW5H3LEQ,AF6SAPRZH3XU4YBLVMC6THTXAPCA","product_id":"B07G3YNLJB","category":"Computers&Accessories|Components|InternalSolidStateDrives","about_product":"240GB 2.5-inch internal SSD, SATA 6.0Gb/s, with blistering speeds of 540 MB/s Read, 500 MB/s Write.|Enjoy the efficiency of Next-Gen Micron 3D NAND: Crucial BX500 uses only a minimal amount of power and still delivers a high price-to-performance.|Upgrade to a drive you can count on: The Crucial BX500 has been thoroughly Tested, and Proven that, it secures your most important files on a drive with established dependability and the advanced features BX-series SSD's which is are known for.|Avoid unintended data loss when the power unexpectedly goes out.

Because it is a braided cable... Chance of it damage are very less... Overall... I like the product \uD83E\uDD1E\uD83C\uDFFB,Using this cable from past 40 days to charge lg g7thinq and samsung s21fe.  So far super,Good,Seems durable but there is a problem with the design that the pin is not long enough / base of the pin is too thick that i couldn't insert it into my phone's charging port without removing the case!,Over all quality bht achhi hai bs jo braided material use hua hai wo nylon nhi hai cotton type ka hai lekin ₹99 me 1.5m cable k hisaab se bht achhi hai majboot hai or charging bhi thik hai. Maine chapti wali buy ki thi jo photo me dikh rhi hai lekin delever ye gol wali hui jo ki jada better look deti hai.

Performance is very nice,I want new hard disc,Really good portable hdd with 1.5 tb storage and speed of 112 approx mb/sec,Data transfer speed is very faster than expected. It runs very smoothly and size is very small. So its easy to cary and moving.,Nice,,Got a little scratched product ( * Not noticeable in normal view and just 1 scratch so not complaining. Got this for 3100-3200₹. Storage capacity showing 1.37tb means rest of it maybe for system backup. Took 47sec to transfer 4.16GB data from laptop to drive through 3.0 usb. Happy with the product at first look. Let's see kaise chalta h.. you can go for this under 3600₹ bcz no one is giving you 1.5tb at this range and remember 1.5TB means you will get less than 1.4 and 1TB means less than 960gb, That's how it is \uD83D\uDE42.","rating":4.4,"discount_percentage":22.0,"product_name":"Western Digital WD 1.5TB Elements Portable Hard Disk Drive, USB 3.0, Compatible with PC, PS4 and Xbox, External HDD (WDBU6Y0015BBK-WESN)","discounted_price":4449.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHQM673VAJUI7R3VMP4NWML4CZLQ,AG7HW2RWBBMIKW45MHWWO3MJPAMQ,AHAMXU574LIAJQEZIHZFB2VF6XEA,AEVK6SQSDGDCBJF4OM2Z24SXE36Q,AEOOR2OZ72WSRAVRX42ADEZNXQSQ,AG7NKDJ76WUK3JVPQ72NHUHHKWFQ,AFLID5BXTJU4P2YML63YQCJDCP2Q,AFI6OXAAZYUPZN5I4RP7TC66JK6A","product_id":"B06XDKWLJH","category":"Computers&Accessories|ExternalDevices&DataStorage|ExternalHardDisks","about_product":"USB 3.0 and USB 2.0 compatibility.
