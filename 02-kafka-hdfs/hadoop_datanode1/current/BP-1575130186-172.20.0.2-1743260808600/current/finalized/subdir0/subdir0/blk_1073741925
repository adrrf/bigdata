I love it because it's supported in micro usb , or type c . Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it's okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel. I need to carry only one cable now with my powerbank. Will recommend.,Best cable,good,Both Micro USB & Type C mobile connector's are getting charge.Good Decision to purchase this product.,Cable is a good fibre braided with good length.The connector also has a tight fit, sometimes you have to apply a bit force to remove(ig it'll wear off after usage).In comparison, boat has a better quality i would say if u get that in offer as it has metal braided cable and better quality microusb pin.,I like the product bcuz it's help me to charge both phone Type C & Micro Cabel","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":60.0,"product_name":"Ambrane 2 in 1 Type-C & Micro USB Cable with 60W / 3A Fast Charging, 480 mbps High Data, PD Technology & Quick Charge 3.0, Compatible with All Type-C & Micro USB Devices (ABDC-10, Black)","discounted_price":199.0,"rating_count":602.0,"user_id":"AHH2TIJJ2IGD5H3DJO3FROUHRRSQ,AF37X7ZH7JPA6H5Q64NV6QFIBCYA,AFKT7LV4XE6XJ2VTHCBHPQECW2RQ,AE7GGDNBOHD2JQ2X5JPD666SAQOQ,AENNAVVG4GBJKDQKJXQUEKQKTXGQ,AFPSO7EYQBYVEJGD4TAT7YFCM6UQ,AFV5W5BR6PKGHPIG3J6TNFK7BSXQ,AHILALAA7Q6SQRTFJVLT75P37FXQ","product_id":"B09CMP1SC8","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","about_product":"Stay ahead and never miss out with a 3A fast charging speed for your devices|It supports Quick Charge 2.0/ 3.0 technology to keep your devices boosted up|Its sturdy design and braided cord are tough enough to withstand 10000+ bends|Crafted for convenience, it allows you to charge and sync data with just one cable|It is widely compatible with all types of Micro USB & Type-C enabled devices","review_title":"Good product,Its good, but micro usb doesn't fit my phone.,Good and useful item,It is very best cable,good,2 in 1 Charging Cable.,Sturdy cable overall,Nice & Best Charger Cabel","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-ABDC-10-Charging-Transmission-Compatible/dp/B09CMP1SC8/ref=sr_1_454?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-454"}

Also, I like collecting a lot of stationery from Japanese manufacturers and this was not as good as I expected so I would rather buy a Uni-Ball Air or a Signo or a Sarasa. Not expecting so much compromise from a brand like Pilot, whose V-Sign is placed at the same price and definitely did not have any quality compromise whatsoever. Anyway, if you want a starter pen take the V7 or something.,My current go-to pen. Highly recommend if you're someone who happens to do a lot of scribbling while writing an exam paper. Really great for annotating stuff which you can erase and correct as and when needed,The pen really erases but; the ink finshed just in a week½; so not to use this pen if you are a student like me.,You need to apply more force and move your hand fast to erase what you wrote,It's a very nice pen, writes very smooth, comparable to a pentel energel gel pen, grip is comfy, it has a nice click sound when retracted, the eraser part gets dirty with oils n dirt sometimes, which when erasing with leaves a faint brown stain due to the oil n dirt, just wipe it with some cloth like your shirt and you'll be fine.

I don't really like that clicking sound of mechanical keyboard as I am a software developer and write codes most of the time. Some times that mechanical sound really irritiates, and sometimes seems stressing out my fingers. This keyboard is good. Works as I wanted it to be. But the real issue is, while I am digging my code with mouse, keyboard light goes off and I need to click CAPS or NUM key to lit it again. Its not an issue for average user, but irritates me as I sometime forget to turn on NUM lock and while typing number in my code, I accidentally change edit mode to INSERT (due to 0 pressed). Otherwise all seems OK. I wish HP had offered Always ON option for this keyboard.,If there is any wrist support this product will skyrocket in its price range,A good product for this price range ,  RGB light is elegant and good quality keys and its built.....!!,Smooth keystrokes.Uneven distribution of the backlight over the font causing hard to read keys. Only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at a perpendicular angle. Since I don't need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing, I can get away with it.There are no indication in the keyboard for the FN + function key combos. Usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with FN.Overall it seems to be acceptable!,Good and value for money,The silver coating came off after 3days.,Does the purpose of back-lit and typing.

Setting it up was a breeze but I faced a silly self-inflicted issue. I entered wrong WiFi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful. When I tried to browse, it showed \"no internet\" connection between the extender and the router. It took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password. Ideally, the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful, it would have saved me some headache to troubleshoot.Extender Coverage:I use the extender to reach a corner of the house about 45ft away from the router where I get sporadic and weak signal (5MBPS). I locate the extender about 30ft away from the router to extend the network and now I get a connection of 20MBPS. It is enough for my work.Speed Test Results:> At the time of testing, my laptop recorded a speed of 90MBPS next to the router.> At the point where I located the extender (30ft away), when directly connected to the router, the laptop recorded a speed of 30MBPS .> At the same point when connected to the extender, the laptop recorded a speed of 27MBPS, only 10% drop (not so bad). 15 feet away from the extender without direct line of sight, the laptop recorded 21MBPS+.Overall, I am satisfied with its performance.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f3cGFTwL._SY88.jpg,Good for home use but its Range is like till one room only it can extend, not much, but good one, like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender , when i started using extender it pulls the Range till this specific room, if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room .,Extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively.  Once concern is i have 5g actfiber signal but this gives 2.5 hz only but still managable for tv laptop mobiles etc for home purpose.","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":56.0,"product_name":"TP-Link TL-WA855RE 300 Mbps Wi-Fi Range Extender (White)","discounted_price":1599.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFPBB55ERBMYZ772BNASND7FMW5A,AHM727ZYMMQDPUHJ6OWCUCU4355A,AFS3O2OIRQF5ECXHPLIAACRYS7ZA,AHMR6LPDRS6LA5Q4IPR7CR5C5UNQ,AHNKAHK6RYA2C67WMJPAHYF2SOOQ,AFAE3QQ4QXQFUDMR6PPV7Z2RBBXQ,AF2XP36RNYHP6ECLKWEGNJMPIMWQ,AG2GORYENZ57Q2GI5YX363VVLIWA","product_id":"B00EYW1U68","category":"Computers&Accessories|NetworkingDevices|Repeaters&Extenders","about_product":"Boosts your existing Wi-Fi coverage to deliver fast and reliable wired and wireless connectivity|External antennas for faster and more reliable Wi-Fi|Supports AP mode which creates a new Wi-Fi Access point|Easily expand wireless coverage at a push of the Range Extender button|Set the Power Schedule for the range extender for power-saving|Interface —— 1 x 10/100mbps RJ45 Ethernet port|Works with Any Wi-Fi Router|In an unlikely case of product quality related issue, we may ask you to reach out to brand’s customer service support and seek resolution.

The battery life is too good if used without LEDs. With LEDs it will last around 2.5 to 3 hours only. Without LED more than 5 hours for sure. Dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying. Justifies he price. Initially I was using JBL GO (version 1) but surely I can say JBL was way too better with bass than this one but obviously JBL wa double the price. Go for it if u want a desent sound quality with fancy led lights. overall 4 star.PS- The size is actually larger that what it feels in the pictures.,It's good for home purpose kids to entertain music and light effect but not for party or something like that,Such a best product at this price but little disappointed as in photos and description they said memory card slot is there but when I get this product, memory card slot was not there but still I like this product and specially lighting effect and good bass sound,Sound is no doubt good.bluetooth range is short... battery life is not up to the mark.Led light is too good.,I would have rated it 5 star but 1 sudden night it really made a chaos! It was uncontrollable, not switching off, made horrific noise out of the blue. I kept it outside whole night so that the battery drained out and next day it was functional. I think that was a software glitch, anyway it didn't appear again for sake!,Good but battery drain pretty fast...,Volume is less,Nice products","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":70.0,"product_name":"boAt Stone 250 Portable Wireless Speaker with 5W RMS Immersive Audio, RGB LEDs, Up to 8HRS Playtime, IPX7 Water Resistance, Multi-Compatibility Modes(Black)","discounted_price":1199.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHL435VQHZZXB545DXGLIZSACFOQ,AG6OEN75DD6ADCNOYEGCMHZRI22A,AF3CWTDKJKG76CDV3IL6X72ZC6EA,AF73CGOZKN7MGOT7NZBIJFV35UQA,AF4CMSAMBV4RKGO4LWDE4LY5K2QQ,AGVG3B4ICKXGMOKDYKEOWIAO7LSA,AFVLASKUEKD7ILQRPFL4TAUJAUUA,AH2Z5DXERV53SFHROV27HKERTZPA","product_id":"B08SMJT55F","category":"Electronics|HomeAudio|Speakers|BluetoothSpeakers","about_product":"Power- Get ready to be enthralled by the 5W RMS sound on Stone 250 portable wireless speaker.|RGB- It dons RGB LEDs, meaning you can uplift the overall vibe during all your playback sessions.|IP Rating- The IPX7 marked water and splash resistant build lets you carry your sound wherever travel without any worry.|Playback- The speaker offers up to a total of 8 hours of playtime per single charge via Type C interface at 60% volume level (non-LEDs Mode)|Modes- You can enjoy the playback via multiple connectivity modes namely Bluetooth v5.0, TF Card and AUX|Controls- The integrated controls help you command playback, volume levels with utmost ease|Lightweight- This wireless speaker has been built keeping in mind the ease of portability, hence the lightweight build.|1 year warranty from the date of purchase","review_title":"Strudy, Awesome connectivity........but bass is NOT upto the mark,Good for home,Superb Product but no memory card slot,Good box as per range,Good,Good but battery drain fast...,Good,Very good","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/boAt-Stone-250-Playback-Hours/dp/B08SMJT55F/ref=sr_1_464?qid=1672903018&s=computers&sr=1-464"}
