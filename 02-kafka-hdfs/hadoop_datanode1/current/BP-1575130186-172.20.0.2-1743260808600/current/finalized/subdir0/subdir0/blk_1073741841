The TV uses WebOS. its snappy. its so so feature rich. The magic remote is amazing. It supports Samsung Smartview and DEX out of the box which means without any internet and wifi etc you can directly cast your screen. Super handy. The sound quality is just so so great for the price. The Remote gets synced with the Airtel DTH and there is dual band support. The HDR gets detected and auto upscaled for Full HD contents in the Hotstar and Netflix. The only cons I find is the power usage which is 100Watt and the smart assistant is pretty useless. The WebOS btw has all essential apps.About VU: Installation is done same day. i cant comment on the durability and future support now. But thats common for all TV comps today except Samsung, LG, Sony and Panasonic.,All fine but remote is a pain. It's too ergonomically faulted for elderly people. Also webos is not the greatest and user friendly.,Good,Really good product overall, bit different from android tv but work almost simler to google or android tv.only feedback is screen mirror feels little bit legging and it would be good if we get mx player in store.,While placing Orders, I asked for Exchange of old Samsung 32” TV, And 2 years Extended Warranty for New TV.  This has Not Come with Delivery.,I like all the features but login for ott apps is a problem which we have to open chrome in mobile or laptop for login in tv","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":54.0,"product_name":"VU 138 cm (55 inches) Premium Series 4K Ultra HD Smart IPS LED TV 55UT (Black)","discounted_price":29990.0,"rating_count":211.0,"user_id":"AEH3MURR76DG3TEX3NXIJVJTKBLA,AGGEFVVI6ZRLVEJHVX6PO5M4CWRA,AGB7DCNVNZ4VY6G33RD333OROE2A,AE5333EQIF5YVB2LAEVCWPH2U5DQ,AEAKVP53B3LBTLJOVAQZUWEF6PYQ,AGH36QL5SGTNWTOYS6O2342SONMA,AG34JWBUWQ3VHVME53EOCLAPIZ4Q,AEZWHWXROPZON2GRB234DUWXQTHQ","product_id":"B0BB3CBFBM","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Televisions|SmartTelevisions","about_product":"Resolution: 4K (3840x2160) | Refresh Rate: 60 hertz | 178 Degree wide viewing angle|Connectivity: 3 HDMI ports to connect set top box, Blue Ray players | 2 USB ports to connect hard drives and other USB devices | 2.4/5GHz WiFi | HDMI CEC & ARC | 2-Way Bluetooth 5.0|Sound : 40-Watt Speakers | 2 Master + 2 Tweeter Speakers | Dolby Audio Sound Enhancement | Ultra Surround | Clear Voice III|Smart TV Features : webOS | Content Store | Magic Remote Control | ThinQ AI Voice Assistant | Alexa Built-in | Wireless Casting | Licensed Apps-Netflix, Prime Video Hotkeys on Remote|Display : IPS Panel | 4K HDR | 400nits Brightness | HDR10 | HLG | Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM) | Game Mode | TruMotion | MEMC | Cricket Mode | Panoramic Viewing|Warranty Information: 1 year warranty provided by the manufacturer from date of purchase|Installation/Wall mounting/Demo will be arranged by AHS Team.

Dont bother trying to play videos from USB. Quality is bad.But when connected to right streaming or display source thru hdmi, it is actually quite good. I mean picture quality, colours, brightness etc for a sub 10k projector. In this department this projector can easily compete with many projectors in sub 15k ranges.Sound is also pretty much okay, loud enough more like boat 5w speakers, may be a bit more louder not good quality wise. Quitr workable as portable solution, but not for a permanent setup.Audio output to my studio headphones are pretty decent quality wise and loud also. Meaning 2.1 speakers can be connected to it, for a higher setup, person has to figure out to seperate the audio at the source itself.From 9ft and 3-4 inches distance of lens to wall, we can get exactly 100 inch(87 inch x 49 inch) projection. So, it can be called as short throw projector, albiet may be border level. There is an option to reduce the screen size upto 75% of original size electronically once connected to HDMI.Keystone correction is not usuable at all. That wheel has to be exatly in middle position to get a good focus on whole screen.That means one has to setup the projector or screen at a fixed location. Can not lilt the projector to move screen up or down and then adjust with keystone correction. I. e if you want to keep the projector screen at lower levels, projector also has to fixed at lower levels only. Best focus can be get, when projecting exactly oppsite to the projector probably 5 to 6 inch above, so if we flip the projector upside down, we get best focus opposite to center a few inches down.For mysetup, where projecting only 1.5 feet above from the floor, going to use a wall mount to setup the projector upside down, this way i can fix the projector a bit more above/behind the sofa. I will post the pics later, once it is setup properly.Now the verdict - this projector with a combination of reflective projector screen( look it up on amazon xelectron or minago brand) is one of most vfm combo for approx 11k for experiencing a very bright 100 inch screen experience of good quality for 1 or 2 person.  But now that im considering buying one of those expensive fixed frame alr projector screens costing upward of 15k to 30k, im thinikg it would have been better if i could have invested a bit more on a brighter projector(look only ANSI value). This buy was more of an impulse purchase, but it is more then good enough for me now to make me consider much costlier projector screens and then later upgrade to a high end projector.Edit: the biggest drawback of this projector is that dust gets inside on lcd panel, which impacts the clarity also after a few days. I had to clean the panel myselg just after 1.5 month.  New lesson learnt, apart from high ansi lumen projector, this is also an important factor for future purchase. Planning to get a custom cloth cover made, so that i dont have to clean it often. Though, Lcd cleaning can be done pretty easily without much opening and its easier compared to youtube videos i have seen for previous model. Somehow lens did not get any dust inside yet. Only the lcd has very very fine dust particles inside.,Quality is good, value for Money. Bluetooth Connectivity is smooth and fast. The sound quality of the Projector is not so great but that we had already considered before. Hotstar App really works nicely with great quality, and so does Youtube. Netflix & Prime video doesn't give the same quality initially, but that must be wifi connection. Some apps however don't get installed, or just close on their own.The good point is the Bluetooth connection, and even we have added a Bluetooth soundbar, so moving it and putting it in any room has become a really good option.,This is indeed a fantastic product in this price range.it is non android so you need to add an amazon fire stick or some other source device through HDMIneedless to say the brightness is pretty good for dark environments and is also watchable during day i.e. if you can cover up your windows and other light sources.Screen spread is Almost up to 120 inch at a throw distance of 13 to 1 feet with the sharpness more or less intact.converts 4K to 1080PWill recommend a tripod mount or a custom made mount like mine.ensure that the walls are white for best image / video reproduction.Definitely recommended at this price point.ConsOnly vertical Keystone correction available,Projector is good so far as it used for last 3 days. May revisit the feedback after a couple of months.,I bought this projector for my classroom and it’s very helpful for their studies. Now students connect themselves more to the world.\uD83D\uDE0A,I feel It's a value for money product as I have already used it for last two months.,If u r looking for a home entertainer projector look no further..... THIS IS IT...!!! BEST IN PRICE, GOOD PICTURE QUALITY, BRIGHTNESS AND A DECENT REMOTE WITH GOOD FUNCTIONALITY... As always premium buyers avoid as these r for normal home with normal needs... Very good for family get together, movie nights and kids will be awe struck at its enormity... I've canceled my dth connection Coz AMAZON PRIME TV STICK WITH THIS PROJECTOR IS ALL I NEED... THAT'S ALL THE TIME I HAVE FOR WATCHING TV AMIDST MY WORK AND THEY DO THE JOB WELL... An entertaining night after a busy day n you will be done satisfied... Any queries ping me I'll help u as much as i can... Don't worry abt specs and other details takeit from a family man,it will satisfy all ur needs,be it surfing, movies or gaming and with fire tv stick mirroring is possible too... Hope it helps...UPDATE AFTER 4 MONTHS - 4HRS/DAY USAGE :The pic uploaded was by noon 1pm with dark screens...HI, THIS WAS A REPLY TO A CUSTOMER TO HELP CHOOSE BETWEEN EGATE I9 N UC 68 & 46,  BUT I THOUGHT IF THIS WAS PUT UP IN UPDATE SECTION A LOT WOULD BENEFIT SO HERE IT GOES...First u need to be clear on ur purpose for this projector like if it's for offic use or home entertainment, also u didn't mention its source like dth or fire tv stick etc... since u have not i'll go with a general review for purposes... IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DETAILED REVIEW SO GUYS WITH OUT PATIENCE CAN RUN TO THE END AT ONCE...!!!I too had a similar confusion based on competition for egate i9 from uc 68 & 46... Let me tell u what helped me decide...First n foremost egate is an Indian company unlike uc which is a common Chinese product with a namesake brand UC (confirmed it with my friend in China)... Hence service n general trust is more on egate than competition...Secondly, from fellow customers, I've learnt that egate is brighter than the rest two...Thirdly, the images are sharp and there's no blur on text on egate compared to the other two... Just learn to adjust the keystone properly...Fourth, the length of the power cord is longer in egate...Fifth, it's got a lens cover to close the lens when not in use... The others don't have it...Now in general I've not used the other two but the input of data for the other two are from their users, so I'm gonna tell u wat I've done n wat else u can do with egate...I've placed it at a length of 15 feet from the screen n it gives awesome display... Connect a 2.1 /5.1 home speaker system if u r trying for home theatre effect but the inbuilt speaker is good enuf at 2/3 feet projection from the end of ur bed with kids sleeping around...I've connected my SECOND FIRE TV Stick, with it so it connects to Wi-Fi for movies n serials n mirroring is done by it for playing from mobiles n game too like cod n pubg n FF... Also u have connectivity for laptop n pendrive etc...U get a remote which functions well along with it...MOST IMPORTANTLY, U CAN CEILING MOUNT IT OR TRIPOD IT TOO WHICH THE OTHER TWO CANT... BUT remember if u r ceiling mounting it u need to flip the display by 180° in the settings coz u would mountbit upside down as the option is provided under the projector but for tripod it's not necessary...Also u can place the projector behind the screen LIKE AN ACTUAL THEATRE IF U R USING A CLOTH SCREEN LIKE ME N CONSTRAINT OF SPACE, BUT REMEMBER TO FLIP THE IMAGE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT IN SETTINGS AS THE PROJECTOR IS BEHIND THE SCREEN N U NEED TO GET A 90° FLIPPED IMAGE FROM BEHIND...so I guess it's the 3d part that made ur decision murky, wat I would love to say for that is I've a Samsung 3d enabled smart tv n I've seen the output of these kind of cheap 3d devices too, since its a low cost projector 3d effects are going to give u a headache coz of pixelation better to opt for a TV if 3d is a priority, as in TV the 3d effects r awesome... But nowadays u can install an APP IN ANY DEVICE to watch 3d movies or better download a 3d movie in pendrive n play it n watch it with ur 3d glasses... My friends do it but I DON'T...VERDICT : \"BEST PROJECTOR IN MARKET IN MY OPINION FOR THE PRICE AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSE\"NOTE : FOR AMAZON PRIME N NETFLIX USERS, IF U R USING A 2.1 AUDIO OUTPUT SOMETIMES U MIGHT NOT GET AUDIO SO DONT GET WORRIED N ITS NOTHING WRONG WITH THE PROJECTOR ITS JUST THAT THE LATEST MOVIES ARE MADE WITH DOLBY 5.1 SOUND SO JUST USE THE ON SCREEN SETTING IN THE VIDEO TO NAVIGATE TO SOUND N CHOOSE STEREO FROM THE DEFAULT DOLBY OPTION & VOILA U R DONE...!!!HOPE IT HELPS, PING ME FOR ANY DOUBTS...HIT LIKE, IF MY REVIEW WAS USEFUL...!!!,As per money it's bestBut if you are fan of pictures qualityThink about budget","rating":3.9,"discount_percentage":41.0,"product_name":"EGate i9 Pro-Max 1080p Native Full HD Projector 4k Support | 3600 L (330 ANSI ) | 150\" (381 cm) Large Screen | VGA, AV, HDMI, SD Card, USB, Audio Out | (E03i31 / E04i32) Black","discounted_price":9490.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AH6QHRMENKX6PFBXHEVDIWEKJSKA,AE5VS52EYPPGCA6BVWXK2NT6NFBA,AGOYOKNFM75VNEGK3DSACVQ6CFUQ,AHGYEGAWBMQGOITR2ZFR7SFSWLGA,AE37UHWDVGTD3RZUERS6DMZ73QIA,AGYYQY3SON5Q4UBPM5NWXQSSLCIA,AG7NSYRU3ZSMSIKJT6P4YIFO6QOA,AHWKKP3N725TNVCGAS3RDM5MNAJQ","product_id":"B088Z1YWBC","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Projectors","about_product":"Display :BIGGER & BETTER - LED, HD Ready (1080p) | (1280 x 720) Native Resolution | 1500 : 1 High Contrast Ratio | 3.81 m (150 inch) Large Screen Display|Lumens: BRIGHTER - 3300 Lumen | 330 ANSI Lumen | LED- Life Long Lamp + 30000 Hours Life |16:9 Aspect Ratio.
