The trick to figuring out is how the cable fits your DP port, both sides. This fit in snugly with GTX and I knew this is gonna work. No need to do any voodoo with pulling cables, powering off this and that, to make DP cable work, just works straight out of the box.Strangely, this cable didn't support my Logitech G603 (wireless gaming mouse) Lightspeed connection. The dongle is attached to the 1st of the two DELL 2520D Monitors. Mouse works when I am viewing over Type-C PD Display with my Laptops. Otherwise Audio, Video, resolution , refresh rates didn't bother.Durability could be a question, let's wait and observe over the days. A lot have commented that this cable didn't last long.,Best in the budget.,This is not Vesa certified cable. sometimes the monitor  goes black for 3 to 4 second.,,The product is good, Its been almost a week I am using this cable. I am using a LG 24GM77 Monitor (1080p 144Hz) As soon as I installed this cable the display went on default refresh rate (60 Hz). Then I went into windows display settings (as Nvidia settings didn't have refresh rate more than 60 Hz) to change the refresh rate to 144 Hz and it switched without any issues. Avoid jerks to the monitor as I figured the display goes off for a brief 1 or 2 secs post jerking. Rest the cable quality is good, However locks to the display ports could be appreciated. Rest all is fine. I hope this review might be helpful.

Wire Quality is Good.,Very good quality but the wire is 15 meters only at least should be 20 meters for the price......\uD83D\uDE13,I am using this with an F&D A140x as my satellite speakers' wires were getting very flimsy. Out of the box these cables are very thick compared to the ones my speakers had before.After replacing the cables with these ones I noticed two things right away1. My speakers are louder2. The sound quality is much betterOne thing you wanna be careful is that these cables stick out like a sore thumb in front of white walls, so if you are like me who cares about the looks, you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like I am planning to do.,Wire is very best quality but cost not worth for it,Durability n quality is absolutely good.,The product is 16 gauge pure copper multi thread wires. Sound quality is impressive.Bears a Black band for +ve/-ve distinction,I've seen many reviews where people complain that this cable is not Copper, its Aluminium and even some saying its fake. So I thought I'll clear some doubts about this product.ITS TRUE! This is not a pure Copper cable, its Copper clad Aluminium. Infact most of the speaker cables are Copper clad Aluminium. Majority of the audio signal travel through the outer edge of the conductor (skin effect), hence the Copper cladding. Thicker the cladding, better the audio quality, this cable only got a thin cladding of Copper The Steel/Aluminium reinforced center is for a more durable conductor. Now no where in the description Amazon has mentioned that this is a pure Copper cladding cable, so just need to get your expectations right. You simply cannot expect Oxygen free pure Copper cable at this price (Rs 400). You will not find a decent 16 gauge Copper speaker cable for less than Rs 2000.This is a cheap 16 gauge speaker and it does the job very well. This cable is more than enough to deliver good sound to your speakers. Cable quality is average but you get what you pay for. Now if got some high end speakers, then I won't recommend this cable.,Good","rating":4.4,"discount_percentage":50.0,"product_name":"Amazon Basics 16-Gauge Speaker Wire - 50 Feet","discounted_price":399.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AE4DPKX5AMUCEWM4543JPWAZVA2A,AH2F6TKL4URXVF2VLVALIU3LA37A,AH4TRU2DCGNKR6IR7W2RIZ5VGILQ,AH7JD2XKCXB32VIEPM4ZMZPFOWGQ,AGUN5Y5M3I3FV5N22KYZUKPU46GA,AGUFGA3PLAEHPSQFXRBSE6LUTOIQ,AH3E36EPFQ2YJEZWSCIN3TQKYWLQ,AFXQA7YBNBU7CB6QVQ7MYYUDP3LA","product_id":"B006LW0WDQ","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Accessories|Cables|SpeakerCables","about_product":"50 Feet of 16-gauge speaker wire|Connects audio speakers to your A/V receiver or amplifier|The plastic jacket around the speaker wire helps to deliver high-quality undistorted signals to and from all of your audio equipment|One side of the wire is marked with a white line, making it quick and easy to distinguish the polarity and get your audio system set up properly|Comes wrapped around a hard plastic spool that makes dispensing convenient and easy","review_title":"Good,Good Quality,Amazing,Wire cost,Quality and performance is excellent.,Really Impressive,Good and cheap!,GOOD ONE","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-16-Gauge-Speaker-Wire-Feet/dp/B006LW0WDQ/ref=sr_1_263?qid=1672909136&s=electronics&sr=1-263"}
