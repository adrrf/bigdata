(Pixel 6a).Unfortunately Indian markets doesn't have much of budget USB C earphones as it's extremely limited in availability so my search gotten narrowed down to this one.Pros:+ Works okayish for the price.+ Sound quality: Average+ Call quality: fairly good. I didn't had much complaints from the other side during phone calls. Tested when riding bike also, there were some wind noises reportedly. But still does the job.+ Buttons: works well. Haven't noticed any niggles thus far.Cons:- definitely not recommended for audiophiles as there's no distinction between highs, mids and lows. Sound quality gets muffled if volume raised above 70%.- bass is not that good. It's there, you can feel it but it's not adequate and gets muddles out if the volume raised. Pls make use of your Eq app (Poweramp Equaliser app, in my case) to tweak up the settings to get noticed on its bass.- Very mediocre performance of mids and highs too. (Gets slightly better if tweaked with an eq app).- causes pain in ears if used continuosly.//If you are looking out for a decent budget USB c earphones mainly for calling, then go with this one. Works well for the voice calls//,It's goodMic is not proper,I think this is the best c type headphone for this price segment. Sound quality, bass, meterial quality all are little above average so for RS.549 (blue) we can definitely buy without second thought.,Worked well for first two months. Now only one side is working.,I bought it to use with my Samsung S7 Plus which does not have any headphone jack. The bluetooth earphones work but when I'm in bed on my side, they have \"accidental touch\" with the pillow or somewhere. So, I bought these USB-C wired headphones. They work with my tab, which is good news. But the audio quality is average. It sounds tinny just like a 100rs headphones. Maybe that is to be expected because these earphones are cheap.

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so there's that!Verdict: Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what it's worth.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":25.0,"product_name":"Redgear A-15 Wired Gaming Mouse with Upto 6400 DPI, RGB & Driver Customization for PC(Black)","discounted_price":599.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFXRH6SHIJIG475VOAVT4QPDJHIQ,AFSUZQF66HKTKPWRUOGXQKZ6VAKQ,AFZVACGHIEIUWBF2UAWI2MU67LCA,AGFNZ473LGYCCHTA6CZKSUAYVN7Q,AFHK3ZGJ2YCZLGNZTHLEN6MVGCAA,AFF4CH4SPZXHDKB5BB25KUX22SBA,AH3NRXRMQGG7MFMMJK6V4WQJYO5Q,AFW7SE27ST3TM7KFAGQEORGOCQJQ","product_id":"B08CHZ3ZQ7","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|PCGamingPeripherals|GamingMice","about_product":"Compatibility: Redgear A15 is compatible with PCs, laptops, notebooks and other devices with a similar input.|Multi Programmable Buttons: The Redgear A15 is designed with multi programmable buttons and also has durable and semi honeycomb design for a better grip.|Upto 6400 DPI: With Redgear A15 you can experience a DPI change of upto 6400|RGB Lighting: A15 comes equipped with customizable RGB mode|Other Features: It comes with a gaming grade sensor for quick movements and reflexes.

Easy and simple to use. Watch face is nice. Battery life is decent. Last for 4 days. Sensors work well. Smooth controls and display is bright. Only issue is that, after the watch came into contact with water it started malfunctioning.

As advertised, this smart watch meets its purpose. Descent size and medium weight to wear always.Few of my suggestion to become a better watch:touch response can be improved, touch accuracy is less.resolution can be still more betterNeed to click on the button to see time or to awake. Instead of pressing button, should have give touch to awake.can have provide some more option like finding phone and finding smart watch ...,Product is good worth the money..there is a bit snag in wakeup mode while moving hands..it takes time to on the screen automatically .Overall good performance,Battery backup not good worst watch only 1 day it will come if you charge 100%....,Bought it 3 months back working fine call quality is good don’t expect great touch sensitivity,Found good and product finishing and features are super,The product is good with good battery life,Nice product but the touchscreen and app could have been better","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":75.0,"product_name":"Fire-Boltt India's No 1 Smartwatch Brand Ring Bluetooth Calling with SpO2 & 1.7” Metal Body with Blood Oxygen Monitoring, Continuous Heart Rate, Full Touch & Multiple Watch Faces","discounted_price":2499.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFUGDQG5WBWBZJE2NX2OICO3UFWA,AHFRVHCEDFHQ4PRJLJHZKNRN34KQ,AHZDDRQIN5ABLJXSOK7EZI2GZHYA,AHCN532M27HWIMZYEX5JVUYXR5EQ,AF6LU7CXBGSR5KKHAJVN2PSESNDA,AG2MRGYFBXUEYGEMBLUJC3F74LJQ,AFF5WUW7WRVIFAPDQNHER4FCQFAA,AERZ4XMT3P4TPSFNUYQ4AKUC6S6A","product_id":"B0972BQ2RS","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Fire-Boltt is India' No 1 Wearable Watch Brand Q122 by IDC Worldwide quarterly wearable device tracker Q122.【Bluetooth Calling Watch】- Fire-Boltt Ring bluetooth calling smart watch enables you to make and receive calls directly from your watch via the built-in speaker and microphone.
