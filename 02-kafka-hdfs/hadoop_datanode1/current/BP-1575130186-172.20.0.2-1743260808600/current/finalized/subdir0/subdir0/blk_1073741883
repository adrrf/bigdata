Even my voice is reaching to opposite party very clearly while calling with watch.# calculator features is useful# Multi Functional crown button is easy and useful .. Easily to change theme with just scroll the crown button# play music directly from the watch with the internal storage although its only 128 mb but sufficient to store around 10 songs approx.. song sound quality is also fine# strap quality is good and soft# TWS connecting features is also niceCons# sometimes i found watch is disconnected with my phone  ..not sure why its happened as i have checked only for one day# fingerprints are clearly visible on  Screen Glass .. i have attached the pic for it#Health Tracker are near to accurate but never rely on smartwatch at this price range.i have measure the bp with this watch and with bp machine both results are different... 70-80% accurate only..# AI Voice assistant is not very useful as it only work for mobile when i press the voice assistant button on watch .. like if i give command to set alarm on watch it set alarm on mobile so basically it just a button to wake up google assistant for mobile phone.#Sometimes when you pick call from your mobile phone call automatically transfer to watch and voice started coming from the watch speaker.. which is quite irritating..this must be correct by firmware updates i have purchased it for Rs.3420/- including bank offer . For this price range overall its a good & premium watch ..Its my experience with this watch for just a one dayRest how it work for long run that depends..,Recieved a damaged device at first... Slight gap between display and body from the left side.. but quickly recieved the replacement next day....The replacement was good...Amazon provided great service and delivered replacement in just 16 hours ...so great job amazon..also i live in bangalore.. so the experience might vary from place to place..ProsSmooth enough UIFairly accurate readings on all the sensorsHeartrate BP and spo2Call quality is great for the price.. good speakers and good mic..You can control spotify and soundcloud music too from the watch .and use tws to listen to spotify while controling with the watch... And it is seamless...Display is great ..colors are punchy and bezels are good enough... Not as narrow as crossbeats ignite s4 max but still good enough...Build quality is good but does not feel very premium.. it does feel like a below 5k watch...So you cannot trick anyone that this is a apple watch \uD83D\uDE02Strap is not too long as every review mentions.. strap is good enough... Not too comfy..I ordered a metal strap from amazon for my watch and it is amazing...Ui looks much better in person than reviews.. UI is smooth and looks good... Not as good as realme watch 3 pro..But still good for the price..Overall its a good watch for the price of around 3.5k -3.9kAnymore and it is not worth the priceRealme watch 3pro is the best at around this price.. so if you get that in stock and for below 4k then get realme watch 3 pro..Or else for this price segment firebolt visionary is the overall best watch compared to all other watches under 4kConsCall when recieved on watch doesnt stay on tws it switches to watch for some reason..which is oneSteps are a little inaccurate and reads steps even if not walking..so dont rely on step counterBattery life is not great if youre using always on display and calling... Maybe around 3 daysBut otherwise battery stays for over 5 days.Blutooth range is not too good.. and varies from watch to watch.. and also phone to phone.. i get a decent bluetooth range of around 20 ft .. but this is more of a fact than a con..,I write this review after 1 week of using this watch, BP, BPM, SPO2 running and sleep tracking functions are working well, watch speaker is also loud and clear to you and the other callers. The only con is when you want to listen to songs through a watch from a mobile its Bluetooth disconnects automatically again and again, as this fund is not useful for me so ignore it, overall it's a good watch.,Everything is absolutely Greta in this smartwatch.But these things could have been better:. Watch faces- you should have the option to add upto 3-4 watch faces at once from the app rather than one at a time and 10 pre-installed ones. App ui could have been better. DND mode absent. No option to toggle Bluetooth (always on),Before review i would like to appreciate this great strategy to pour out honest reviews from users by giving them bookmyshow voucher.I loved the Touch Screen experience & Amoled screen of the watch, it gives a feel of premium watch. The band of the watch is average & doesn't look premium & i separately ordered a metal band. I am expecting Mobile App improvement from FireBoltt as I don't find it good enough if I compare it with Boat's App for its watches (As I own a Boat smartwatch). Rest Visionary is a good buy & worth the money the only thing which physically is not appealing is the average quality of the band.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":78.0,"product_name":"Fire-Boltt Visionary 1.78\" AMOLED Bluetooth Calling Smartwatch with 368*448 Pixel Resolution 100+ Sports Mode, TWS Connection, Voice Assistance, SPO2 & Heart Rate Monitoring","discounted_price":3999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHQIYGWISGS2IQAQ3OM4IZHKIV4Q,AGXCRSJZ5RYOGMFVSLNRCILGSATQ,AE4MORXG46LGABI76KRVGV5BCLMQ,AHPN4Q3AZDX3HSUYDT7MHYDIL6QQ,AGBOBQFRZDOF5XPJRLHJYOGRFKNA","product_id":"B0B3NDPCS9","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Fire-Boltt is India' No 1 Wearable Watch Brand Q122 by IDC Worldwide quarterly wearable device tracker Q122.【Bluetooth Calling Watch】- Fire-Boltt Visionary enables you to make and receive calls directly from your watch via the built-in speaker and microphone.

Else if used optimally, can last 7-8 days with moderate use.2.less choice of inbuilt watch faces3.Watch strap could have been of better quality.4.Screen can catch scratches, need to buy a cut screen guard for the screen.Overall this Smart watch is a beast in this range (₹1999)P.s: I have used colorfit pro 2 earlier. Ratings and reviews are according to that.,Everything is great in this Watch it dose have calling , games , fin perfectly in all hands health tracking and etc, but after all watch is great but there is only one con - batter backup is less battery gets discharged in just 15 hours if you will keep it wear all day , i hope fire boltt will fix it. Overall best value to money product \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDC4D,Many watches comes with the same features at the same cost so u may have a lot of varieties to get confused with,though i can say that this one i got here has stable ui,no lag even,feels premium (mainly the soft strap and the cool crown button adds up much)..the main reason I bought this because it brings all the features everyone needs today with out of the box looks.If someone feels that they have a thin wrist and it wouldn't fit them,don't worry.Even i thought it wouldn't fit me coz i have a thin wrist but it was just fine.,Got delivery in a day. Prompt service by Amazon. Package was sealed. Did not find any tampering. Watch body is plastic built. At this price point, could have been metal one. Detailed review will be shared in few days,Now after the battery gets fully charged it drains from 100 to 0 % in just 10 minutes .i don't know what happened to it .,Watch design is good. In picture shows dark grey color watch but i recived silver grey. Screen wakeup time is slow otherwise everything is good.,Using this watch for couple of days now. Overall I liked it. Readings are almost correct. Hope it'll be durable as well.,Value for money.Only con is that rise to wake up sensor works very slow.","rating":4.4,"discount_percentage":75.0,"product_name":"Fire-Boltt Tank 1.85\" Bluetooth Calling Smart Watch, 123 Sports Mode, 8 UI Interactions, Built in Speaker & Mic, 7 Days Battery & Fire-Boltt Health Suite","discounted_price":2999.0,"rating_count":768.0,"user_id":"AHBB6UBYHJ5FH2BUFQ2BCXHWQFJQ,AE4S7RU4C77FN2E57NMJIFAMH7RQ,AHAUWOVUAQX7D73DVER7HM3WKQZQ,AFVUKW5J3PRPHQ5ZIFK275YXQOPQ,AFXAQKHWVGXPXQ34RWZX3QER6MFA,AF3Q3H3ST2EQI2CBI5V2AZFGETRQ,AGI6BX5V7Y2QSCVLAAHXBHEHQ7VQ,AHVWARXU523WDIQTATHFC5NICFFA","product_id":"B0BNXFDTZ2","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Largest 1.85\" Display : View bigger on the screen with the industry’s largest 1.85\" display covering every edge possible and providing a crystal-clear resolution of 240*280 pixels|Bluetooth Calling On The Go - With Fire-Boltt Tank Smart watch, you have the freedom to access a quick dial pad and sync speed dial contacts on the watch.
