I got it in the offer and it was totally worth it.Pros:-1. Sound is awesome - 100% satisfied with the quality of sound. Dolby Audio 20W speakers are really great for sure affordable TV.2. Size and slim - It is slim and looks stylish. Very light weight and handy to install.3. Easy to install and mount to wall.4. Tye software installation and set up is very easy and anyone can do it at home.5. It gets integrated with mobile apps, remote, WiFi networks very quickly and easily.6. The overall sign up process and app installations are quick and automatic.7. It supports all the smart features like Netflix, Prime and YouTube. It is easily installable and sign-in to start using quickly.8. It is also easy to scan the Setup box channels and start viewing them.Cons:-1. Picture quality is 776p. It's average and not very clear. But it is worth the price range. I'll not complaint as the cost of TV is very affordable and this quality is justified.2. Bluetooth and WiFi connection can disconnect sometimes and cause some issues. I encountered this disconnect issue and had to reset complete device and do the complete sign up again.Rest all is very good and loved this product. I feel it was worth ordering. If you are looking something is medium range and only need it for your old parents and don't have extensive smart use then 100% go for this.If you want to use a lot of smart features and OTT platforms and watch movies, and sports then go for better version with full HD and 4K quality. This TV will not give good experience for sports due to less picture quality but it's very good for daily family shows and TV channels.One last thing I want to express and I'm ver disappointed about is this.I got my order delivered on Friday and I scheduled my installation for Saturday. But nobody turned up that day and I had to reschedule it for Tuesday morning, and even today nobody turned up. I got a call from Amazon to reschedule it for Tuesday evening and still, nobody turned up.This is very very bad and irresponsible service by OnePlus and Amazon. I'm very disappointed with the service and highly criticize this behavior. A company should always take care of its customer satisfaction and you have failed in doing this.What do you guys expect us to do? Wait for 5 to 6 days to get my TV installed even when it's been delivered and wait for you guys to come after so many days. Even when I'm having my smart TV delivered to my home, I have to wait and not enjoy it because you guys have not done your job properly.At least keep some decency and respect the customers who are paying a big amount and ordering a big item from your company. You should take care that the money I spent has been worth it and not facing any issues. Highly disappointed with this behavior and service.,Good product,Connectivity is faster,But performance is little bit slower,,The biggest problem I face is it don't have a aux cable so I'm not able to connect my sound bar......the HDMI port is useless it won't work .so,i connect it via bluetooth but the problem is that it won't connect automatically, everytime I on the tv i need to connect it manually it's a basic feature which is not provided in this tv then another drawback is that it was fast at the beginning now it's been 4 months and it's super laggy .....even after the update its just the same.....yeaa but in this price range the picture quality is outstanding......that's all,Good quality in picture and volume is little bit low other than that product is nice. Budget friendly, I'm happy with this .,After a few days, the TV will perform slowly and the  remote  is very very sentence,thank you amazon and oneplus,1. Sound is good2. Easy installation3. very Slim and less weight4. Voice recognition is good,LikeBudget-friendlyDislikeWiFi connectivity range is poor.Many times gets disconnected.Color depth not that good.","rating":4.2,"discount_percentage":22.0,"product_name":"OnePlus 108 cm (43 inches) Y Series Full HD Smart Android LED TV 43 Y1S (Black)","discounted_price":24999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFUT7ANZTZYGLXU65EQ2D5OP6UMA,AGT7YYJVUC6ZHRKQHVUQZMDNLXEA,AE7OMK3IQJR2U2JZE2HQ4BKSPA6A,AGCRCU432TIF4J2EL7GBEWOIULGQ,AERQBL3BISJQVHO3RLOOA4HKZX5A,AHIWNZ2HBQAHVE4OWODM6WH4PMOQ,AH2347WTE3DZ3TIZUB5LCLZPAYEQ,AHIH3QL5XONYJWEXF7VKLFHZBDJA","product_id":"B09Q5P2MT3","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Televisions|SmartTelevisions","about_product":"Resolution : Full HD (1920x1080) | Refresh Rate : 60 Hertz|Connectivity: 2 HDMI ports to connect set top box, Blu Ray players, gaming console | 2 USB ports to connect hard drives and other USB devices | Dual-band Wi-Fi|Sound : 20 Watts Output | Dolby Audio | Dolby Atmos Decoding|Smart TV features: Latest Android TV 11, OnePlus Connect Ecosystem, Google Assistant, Chromecast, Miracast, DLNA, Auto Low Latency Mode | Supported Apps : Netflix, Youtube, Prime Video, Hotstar, SonyLiv, Hungama, JioCinema, Zee5, Eros Now, Oxygen Play|Display : Bezel-less Design | LED Panel | Anti-Aliasing | Gamma Engine | Decoding of HDR10+, HDR10, HLG|Warranty Information: 1 year comprehensive warranty and additional 1 year on panel provided by the manufacturer from date of purchase|Installation/Wall mounting/demo will be arranged by Amazon Home Services.

Quick Response:- After the TV is delivered call the customer care for the installation and within 2 hour technician arrive and installed the TV. After that received call back from the customer care to gather the experience and pinged on whatsapp so that if in future encountered any issue quick help will be provided.2. Quality:- Quality of TV is good and can watch all the contents from the apps in max resolution supported by TV i.e., 1080p.3. Steal deal, during the GIF sale received the TV in 13299 which is just wow price.4. Sound Quality is good.5. Android 11 is good and the extra feature which I find beneficial when compared to my old android 9 tv is the voice search feature which now search the content from another apps also after giving permission which is not working on android 9 tv.6. Bluetooth remote with some extra feature. Bought the TV as already have the TCL s6500 32 inch model back in 2018 when it is launched and tv is working flawlessly and since did not encountered any issue so bought this brand tv again when required second TV.Improvement :-1. Bluetooth remote should have the all apps button on remote instead of TCL menu which my previous android s6500 tv have, due to which have to move with some extra click which is annoying for my parents to use.2. in Bluetooth remote they provide some extra button to move directly to youtube, netflix, tcl channel, prime, guard and media, instead of this some customization be provided so that we can configure the buttons to some others apps as per our personal use. out of these button guard, media and tcl channel are most useless button.3. android tv should come with atleast 1.5gb as with 1 GB variant the tv is little slow and already have many preinstalled tcl apps which we cannot remove so tv experience in little bit slow, however buy the model by knowing this limitation as already using 1.5 GB ram old variant of the same brand.other feature are also these which are cons but those are already mentioned in description and user should be aware of them before buying like one such point is 3.1 star is removed because of point 1 and point 3 as it is not making fluid experience of using android tv when watch all the contents from the apps.,Good for value almost all apps r able to download,Less weight and pretty valuable to the budget... And even customer support also available all time.,Like,Good one for this price. .

Seems worth the value.,Good product,This is a useful product ever✅,Every thing ok,Good,क्वालिटी में अच्छा नहीं है पर सही चल रहा है।","rating":3.7,"discount_percentage":65.0,"product_name":"Gilary Multi Charging Cable, 3 in 1 Nylon Braided Fast Charging Cable for iPhone Micro USB Type C Mobile Phone | Colour May Vary |","discounted_price":345.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AH5JH2QLZDYXTHIDXBBLTDHQUALA,AGY6OOO6NIXEY5CJIHB4LUUUQJLQ,AHCJ2GWM5V4XDOBLR4UU2RV4ERKA,AFBURR5C3CR7XL4WPXXV5ZEDDZPA,AFWFYPM37ORBVNKGLW4EETQML7TQ,AHFT6MCOAFZXAUNCYQYPBI7YYF4A,AHA2QGFQYDUQ57OW7ATIM3QVTIIA,AFI5YRB4PKR26ECAXNTMOWMXMEQA","product_id":"B08LKS3LSP","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","about_product":"The cable comes with 3 Different pins allowing you to charge your Android, iOS and Type-C devices at the same time|High-quality copper wires promote maximum signal quality and strength|Ensure a maximum charging speed up to 2A, charge faster than most standard cables.|This multi charger cable widely compatible with all Smartphones.|What You Get: 1 x 3 in 1 Multi Charging Cable (with Mini USB, Micro USB, Type C)","review_title":"Product is nice,Decent cable,It charges all the three types,Value of money,Product is good and worth of money,Good material.... working good,Very good,ठीक ठीक है","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Gilary-Charging-Braided-Magnetic-Charger/dp/B08LKS3LSP/ref=sr_1_109?qid=1672909129&s=electronics&sr=1-109"}

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It’s compatible with all. It’s plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I’m working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it’s not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would’ve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn’t make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps. Thanks.","rating":4.5,"discount_percentage":42.0,"product_name":"TP-Link UE300 USB 3.0 to RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter - Plug and Play","discounted_price":1099.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHQC27SWWMUOTO3W7NGIG7KPX2AQ,AH3ZNJWSAOEWIBD3NFLGHZZOOMIQ,AFAFMRV4L35642NQMP3WELYPQ6ZQ,AG6GKJFYOVO2OJCRV73FBUIBAJLQ,AEWU6OTDLIVY6F2UAY2UYYQSGOPQ,AFOPBEQ5YUOBWJ7TBDFITQFZSN3Q,AETRLRK4QNNUXN3RRQ7BWMBAFXCA,AFXO2ER7GFIH4WDPPZX6LRZX3X7Q","product_id":"B00V4BGDKU","category":"Computers&Accessories|NetworkingDevices|NetworkAdapters|WirelessUSBAdapters","about_product":"Fastest USB 3.0 and Gigabit solution ensure high-speed transfer rate|Plug and Play for Windows (11/10), Mac OS (10.9 & later versions), Chrome OS, and Linux OS.|Foldable and Portable design ideally suits your Ultrabook|In an unlikely case of product quality related issue, we may ask you to reach out to brand’s customer service support and seek resolution.
