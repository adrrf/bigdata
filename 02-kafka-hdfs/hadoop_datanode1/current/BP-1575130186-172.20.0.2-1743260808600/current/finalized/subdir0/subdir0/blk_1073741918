It couldnt even take my ring figure pressure. First time I repaired it with huge cost, but second time had to throw it.. Then I bought this one, slightly smaller as I was afraid not to pay too much. LG had in-built speaker but this one does not. There is no speaker/mike. The picture quality is good. I have a Dell soundbar for audio/mic, so that is covered. The brightness is too much at 100% but I can reduce it to 40% which is good enough for me.The monitor includes power chord and HDMI Cable. It has a nice sturdy stand. The build quality is good. The Viewing angles are also good, with no glare from room lighting. Overall the picture quality is quite good.  The monitor also has eye care settings. There are couple of separate screws provided in a plastic cover, so be careful while unpacking. I had no missing screws problem.,I have been using for my personal and office work. It's a good product when you like to splitting the screen and work simultaneously in two different windows.The experience is far great,Came with the just the OEM package slapped with invoice but the product was safePros1. 24 inch screen pixels are small enough u can see it if u try but not bad2. Ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad3.75 hz but meh i can't tell the difference but again i have 120 hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for 75 hz4.colors are good movies and games pop out well5. Comes with a HDMI cable which is neat6. Build it good and angle of the monitor can be movedCons1,has like a slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but u could get used to it2. 75 hz is a gimmick3. No display port which so bad4. Ips glow is there not much but dark things will look grey5.game mode is useless and eye blinding6.the power cable has a adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is a brick VerdictI would say don't buy this just for the 75hz it's not worth it i would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get a higher refresh rate monitor i wouldn't say this was a waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat it's offering,Pros:1. Good display quality2. ??That's the end of ProsCons:1. WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH THERE IS NO AUDIO JACK?!?!!!!What is the use of HDMI port if user can't get VIDEO AND AUDIO both??2. IF SOMEONE IS INVESTING 10K ON A MONITOR WHY IN 2022 ANYONE WILL NEED A VGA PORT??3. Build quality is questionable, Entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard I screwed the stand it was still the same.4. AMD Freesync isn't much affective, you can still see screen tearing.5. Stand Movement is very stiff, I almost felt like I broke it. Just bad build quality.If you are only going to use HDMI port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on PC and console both this is not good enough.If you are willing to sacrifice little bit of Visual quality and 15Hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for BenQ, Same price but less hassle.OrBetter bump up your budget go for LG 24MK600M which goes for 13k or less but worth it,,It could have one more HDMI port,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vMbxznwhL._SY88.jpg,Perfect monitor for editing and casual gaming","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":47.0,"product_name":"Samsung 24-inch(60.46cm) FHD Monitor, IPS, 75 Hz, Bezel Less Design, AMD FreeSync, Flicker Free, HDMI, D-sub, (LF24T350FHWXXL, Dark Blue Gray)","discounted_price":10099.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AGYJWE5KU7LQVHHG3UBK4DGPWP5A,AFAW4JGIBKTJDQE4EHYSG5PTAOOQ,AHJW63Z3OYPN456LWSNIFUY4QHBQ,AHX4QZLN7AZB65JUWMDFEDFMXDNA,AFCJIUIGZNR72BMVUBH6QSOJML4A,AHODCGFP6G5DRC3ZJONS3SKGNYUA,AFBRSDA6IG6CQY4IGPKXUR4ESI4Q,AFHI5YETSSJR7CTVO2PP6ATKWBBQ","product_id":"B08J82K4GX","category":"Computers&Accessories|Monitors","about_product":"24 inch Samsung Monitor - 1,920 x 1,080 Resolution IPS Panel Monitor|3-sided borderless display for All-expansive view|Fluid pictures with 75hz refresh rate | 5 ms response time | 250cd/m2 Brightness (Typical)|Aspect Ratio: 16:9 | 178° Horizontal and Vertical Viewing Angle|FreeSync and Game Mode to adjust any game and fill screen|Eye Saver Mode and Flicker free to reduce eye strain|Connectivity : D-Sub Port, HDMI|3 Years Warranty on Product From Manufacturer","review_title":"Good one,, bright!,Great product altogether,Good but there are better options,Good monitor but bad build quality with some dumb design choices,Very nice\uD83D\uDC4C\uD83D\uDC4C\uD83D\uDC4C\uD83D\uDC4C\uD83D\uDC4C,Overall good.

What I like the most is how easy is to keep because of the connector. The color options are neatly wide, and I like it. I would say though it's not very smooth of you use it for color filling, it does get smudge if you double coat it.

Otherwise, it's good overall.,Eays to use for kids above 6 years,simply good,The connectors provided help to keep all the pens together.

I quite impressed with packaging n box content they are USPNext comes plastic quality that is also good installation was also easy by following manual.. link for video would be more helpfulIt do have sometime connecting issue that's random..Which could be the reason this is reasonably priced..Next version should improve that rest happy with purchase,It provides excellent backup for above 4 hrs but during power cut the router restarts once again which created interruption in the internet connections for few minutes... Overall an Awesome Product,I have tested and it's working for power back-up up to 2 hrs...,Perfect for wifi usage upto 3 hrs of power backup provided. Easy to install and use,Good products,Update 2...1. Item runs 1hr 14m @1A giving 15.465Wh, runs 48m @1.5A giving 14.82Wh whereas its rated at 22.2Wh & since its april'21 made, i'd say battery is defective & wont last me long, ordered replacement.2. Replacement runs 1h 32m @1A giving 19.39Wh, 1h 1m @1.5A giving 18.452Wh & being made in nov'20 i think this batt is alright. I'm keeping the replacement & ending my review unless item fails catastrophically.=======Update...1. This is what \"make in India\" has become- a plethora of Indian registered companies slapping their logo & selling chinese items in India, to cash in Indian sentiments. This is a generic item sold by slapping diff brand names like zinq, quantum (available right here on amazon) & prolly more. Even the boxes r exactly same... lol.2. Recharge rate is horribly slow @0.5A, so 2.2Ah will take 4.4hrs, considering losses 4.5hrs. That's why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby. So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts (like me with community generator).3. Ups has to be turned ON to recharge... what? why? lame! This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue & since item is generic, ZINQ prolly doesn't even know... lol... such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself. I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter & wow! It didn't charge a bit.4. Had i been younger with lotza free time, i could've made one myself for ₹80+80+80+150+50 for 1.8Ah one... Gone r those fun days! So I'm keeping it for ₹1001.** if any1 is reading my review, youtube search for \"router ups\" & lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIY.===============Damn this thing can output over 35watts of power @12v. For the 1st time something has out-specked my 35w load tester.Pros-1. Can output 3A or even more, that i could test. Great for sudden load surge.2. Very stable output 12-12.1v throughout 0-35w.3. Solid built, almost all possible connectors provided, seamless switching from AC to battery (obviously), easy to use.Cons-1. No polarity changing option for in/out. Some items/chargers do have center negative, for that i have to make my own cable.2. Since it went 3A or above, i dont think theres any overload/short circuit protection.3. Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins. I hope theres thermal protection.4. Item is sealed shut.

If you are a amateur gamer it's completely fine at this price...but If you are hardcore gamer pro level then I will suggest you to pay a bit more and go for a better one because sometimes out of no reason some movements doesn't work ...when i Play cricket suddenly in the middle of the match one shot selection doesn't work and it disrupts the momentum......

The L2 and R2 are a bit tight, but other than that no issues! I ruff use a lot when playing and this is very durable, (although it does not have markings for grip) the grip is good too.
