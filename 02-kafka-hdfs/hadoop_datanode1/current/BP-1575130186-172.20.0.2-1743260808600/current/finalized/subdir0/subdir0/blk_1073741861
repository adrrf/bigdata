The screen is not full HD but still offers good brightness and color accuracy. Speaker also sounds good enough. Front camera is not for selfies only for video calls but back camera produces satisfactory clicks for entry level. Battery backup is one of the best features of this device. Samsung softwares are all well optimised and my only complaint in this department is the pre-installed bloatwares. UI feels smooth enough and the mediatek processor coupled with 4GB RAM is well suited for daily normal usage. Games are not recommended. Biggest disadvantage of this device is it's in box charger which is only 7.75 watts (5v, 1.55a) that takes about 3 hours for a decent charge.,\uD83D\uDD25 Heating issues during use with in 15 minutes uses.Touch screen \uD83D\uDCF1 issues some times it's too great and some time u have to touch several times even on samsung key pad while typing.We all family are using samsung mobiles but this time I worried of issues if I have to face same issues i have to change mobile and transfer data it's very irritating work I wish to if any one of samsung is reading this review please reply me through Amazon.\uD83D\uDD25 15 मिनट में उपयोग के दौरान हीटिंग की समस्या।टच स्क्रीन \uD83D\uDCF1 कभी-कभी जारी करती है यह बहुत बढ़िया है और कभी-कभी आपको टाइप करते समय सैमसंग कुंजी पैड पर भी कई बार स्पर्श करना पड़ता है।हम सभी परिवार सैमसंग मोबाइल का उपयोग कर रहे हैं लेकिन इस बार मैं मुद्दों से चिंतित हूं अगर मुझे समान मुद्दों का सामना करना पड़ता है तो मुझे मोबाइल बदलना होगा और डेटा ट्रांसफर करना होगा यह बहुत परेशान करने वाला काम है अगर कोई सैमसंग इस समीक्षा को पढ़ रहा है तो कृपया मुझे अमेज़ॅन के माध्यम से उत्तर दें .,Bought for mom as she just want to use for calls.
