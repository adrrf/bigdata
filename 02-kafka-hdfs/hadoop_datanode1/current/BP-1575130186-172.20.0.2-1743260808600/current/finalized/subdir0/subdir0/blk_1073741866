It lacks base. Battery backup is good. ANC is a myth in this earphone. It might hurt your ear if you wear it for longer duration depending on the shape of your ear,Eat easily fit in ears and light weight ,and sound quality is good too. Over all its worth to by this samsung buds ita connects well to the samsung mobile too.,Bought this solely due to its form factor - to try how samsung has made them to sound in this open bud style. To be true Samsung has managed excellently to give us an unique TWS.This is not an inear style TWS but resembles somewhat earbud style TWS, only of its kind in the market as far as my Knowledge goes.They are held very good in my ears, gives me a good seal and does not fall out (strange as I can't use earbuds because they fall out frequently). It seems that Samsung has finalised the shape after a good homework. However, it doesn't mean that it will fit everybody as there are many dissatisfied users around the globe.The finish, build and all such generic factors are top notch.  The size of the buds and the case is very small.Now about the sound. If the buds fit in one's ears with a good seal, the sound is full bodied but if the seal is not perfect, it may be tinny.The sound signature is very bassy for my taste and I have to eq it to my taste. The bass is so pounding that sometimes it becomes difficult to get a taste of the treble. I listen it in TREBLE BOOST mode adjusted through the app. ANC works strangely and noise reduction is not very decipherable. In contrary, ANC ON somewhat opens up the sound. Don't buy this for ANC.Strangely to me, these buds sound better on my iPhone 12mini than my Galaxy S22 (Spotify and Apple Music). The buds have app support for both Android (Galaxy wear) and iOS (Galaxy Buds Live) but the Android app is more feature packed and works better.  The iOS app couldn't update the firmware (although there is a Menu in the app) and always showed the device to be on latest firmware. However,  as soon as I connected with my S22, on pairing,  the first thing it did was to update the firmware.I love these buds solely for their form factor and they are pretty good for 4.4K against an MRP of 16K. The do sound very good but does not suit my taste.  Persons loving bass may love them. Don't get them for ANC. Battery consumption not yet fully tested but seems ok. It has wireless charging too. If your ears are too small or too large than normal - better not to buy as they may either not go in the ears or will fit loose giving a improper seal.,Best call quality. Noise cancelling could have been improved to best, but still wotks good.Descent battery life.Music is good. Not to that top notch, but good in this segment.Overall worth for buying with good call quality a very little to compromise but good.,I am using this for like 3 months it is a good and productive if you are in the samsung ecosystem if you are not a part then do not buy it its not worth its price.,Bluetooth range is not that good,The sound quality is extremely good for a tws and the sound signature is almost flat. I got these for Rs.5290, it almost felt like a steal deal for me until I faced one cardinal flaw in the design of these buds. The bluetooth antenna has an absymal performance. It feels like I am using bluetooth v3.0. The range is so poor that even if you put the phone in the pocket, the audio starts stuttering. The mic quality is a hit or miss, inside the house it works very well, but outside it performs poorly. I think it has more to do with poor antenna design than the microphone's quality. If you are thinking that maybe the faulty product is an exception, then do a google search about its range issue and you will find hundreds of people complaining about the same thing. Samsung has poorly implemented the design and is reluctant to admit its fault. I pity those who bought it at around 15k for such a flawed product. Even at Rs 5k it is not worth it because of the range issue. It is better to buy a wired IEM, atleast it will sound better than this.,In this price Samsung brand is goodEasy to wear and good battery backupHardly support the 2 meter Bluetooth connectivity","rating":4.0,"discount_percentage":70.0,"product_name":"Samsung Galaxy Buds Live Bluetooth Truly Wireless in Ear Earbuds with Mic, Upto 21 Hours Playtime, Mystic Black","discounted_price":4790.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHPK4PXDZS4FBECPMPFQOZRLDPAA,AFDZPGN3IBUCVS4QG4U5YCG4QZMA,AGXRKO2ZS34CPIT4HVKL4ZVP7UMA,AGAYLHB4FT5IE4A5NXOCGX6VDWUQ,AHXFVLYGYVEDJD4JY35L425PK5YQ,AHTHZGMRK6ZMTCCPSKOGS7GTFGPA,AFNZPK76SJ4OIOZUZPZUKEDOMJQA,AHDSEBUBYJQEKVHY277BC2ZKYPYA","product_id":"B08FN6WGDQ","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|In-Ear","about_product":"For any product related queries contact us at: 1800407267864|1 year warranty provided by the manufacturer from date of purchase.Note : If the size of the earbud tips does not match the size of your ear canals or the headset is not worn properly in your ears, you may not obtain the correct sound qualities or call performance.

Review 1 is 30 days after purchase (Typos in the Review 1 has rectified now) and Review 2 is 15 days post Android 13 beta update. These reviews are based on my own personal experience of the device purchased here in Amazon on 1 August 2022.Before OOS 13 update, 5G (only for Jio) was enabled via another update. 5G is still not available in my region. Hence, 5G related parameters are not covered in this review.Review 2: After about 15 days of Oxygen OS 13 Beta update (Android 13):(Update received on 1 Dec 2023).Note: After the beta update, no new issues popped up.i.e., there were;No Heating related issues.No fast battery drain.No change in the Charging time.No annoying bugs.No change in camera performance.Beta update is mostly like a Stable update.OOS 13 (Android 13) update review:Delighters:> No new apps added. Absolutely NOT.> System storage consumption remains the same (13.2 GB).> Animations are more fluidic.> More customization UI features added. (Scout widgets in home screen, Enlarged folder & lot more.)> Daily data usage is available in the notification panel and need not be reset daily unlike earlier.> Slight improvement in the Front Ambient light sensor.> Ability to play videos in the background & screen OFF as well (even for YouTube)  (Really a welcoming & longing feature, which other brand UIs have not or only with screen OFF)> Stand-by battery life has improved substantially.Disappointers:> Brightness at lowest level is brighter than before.> No improvement in Sound levels. Still initial 40% is too silent.> No Dolby Atomos (which was mentioned for OOS 13). Perhaps, to wait for Stable update.> Auto brightness latency is higher than earlier. Response time is tad increased.> Haptics have become tighter than earlier, but still not stronger.=======================================================================Review 1:Verdict - A Good Buy in this price range in 2022.Note:- This review is after a month's usage.- Received 2 updates during the course of time (Recent update was of 0.98 GB).- System consumes 13.2 GB space. 128 GB variant is pretty adequate for a normal usage.- N77 band is missing for 5G.- The unit I bought DOES NOT have any sort of heating issues or fast battery drain issue.- Shifting from a 120 Hz to this 90 Hz mobile. No noticeable difference observed. ( In Non-gaming aspect)- Nothing Great or Noting worse in the unmentioned parameters.Things that are delighting;> Exceptional signal reception (especially 4G+ carrier aggregation). Very fast download speeds.> Insane Fast charging (0 to 100% in 40 mins, 30 to 100 % in 20 mins, excluding trickle charge). No heating of the mobile (just slight warming) during charging.> Stand by charge and SoT is fantastic (Even more than 7.5 hrs, for Videos, YT and general tasks and calls, even in mobile data always ON and AOD set to Battery saver.> Oxygen OS = Color OS/Realme OS - Bloatware. The skin is really good & nothing to complain like other brands' UI.> Absolutely no 3rd party bloatware and no ads in the UI or any 2nd party apps. Even some 2nd party apps are \"un-installable\". No major bothering bugs noticed till date.> Yes, the \"Alert slider\" is included, unlike some premium OnePlus models.Things that are annoying;> Dual ambient light sensor (1 in rear and other in front) is not well calibrated. The brightness is always in the lower side and frequent manual increase in required.> Volume level is useless until 40% level (can be audible only in \"Pin-drop silence ambience). Audible enough only post 40% level. Stereo speakers output are 70% bottom and 30 % earpiece. But full volume doesn't distort & is loud enough.> Haptics are tight but not strong, even in higher levels. Effective only post 40% and best only @ 90% level)> Hotspot drains battery quickly (even a warning notification pops up). Also, Chrome and Google app eats away battery quickly. Parallel downloads makes the area near the camera module warm).> Though the in-hand feel is good, the buttons are of no close tolerances and wobbles a bit.> Data billing cycle to be reset daily to show the daily data usage in the notification panel.> The inbuild DAC (no 3.5 mm hole and only Type-C port) is not great. The Dirac equalizer is also not yielding best output. Perhaps, Dolby Atmos support in OOS 13 could improve the audio output.,Overall it's a good mobile phone. The speed and interface is all good but expect battery to last long. Not much, i always keep it in battery saving mode and work for about 18-20 hours on normal use.. not many themes available. Samsung is better in that sense.. there are many wallpapers and themes available. Display is clear and camera is also good! Overall okay.,I got this mobile (12Gb, 25Gb Ram variant)at 31k after 3k discount on icici credit card.For this price it's a must buy.I am using this product since last 2 weeks.The camera is pretty good and the screen and sterio speakers are also working very well.The only complaint I can say is the battery life could have been better, as a working professional it doesn't makes a lot difference for me but who is a heavy user they will need to charge it twice a day.If you have no issues with the battery section then just go for it.\uD83D\uDC4D,Battery drains like any thing. Rest all good.I have to recharge twice a day, don't buy if you want a good battery backup.Even though phone is fast charge, I am disappointed with battery life.,I bought 12gb and 256 and it's working very smoothly, for normal regular use you can go for it.,There is problem with temper glass part , front Cemera area temper glass not installing,Good but not so fast as I think 12gb 256 it's ordinary like 8gb .,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":0.0,"product_name":"OnePlus Nord 2T 5G (Jade Fog, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage)","discounted_price":33999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AEREO7C5GLYYYV6YXK7X4UCCQTJQ,AHWISRUJUCJG6UH4FFVSPKDJS2BQ,AFIKGABHNR4JSITY4CNM6TMO54EA,AHTWYLMZUCB6QUCNPXWZ2PCKDGRQ,AGBIS5BRLLI652XO3V53YOJMZXXA,AFUT3A3MXCM4JN4XUGMFUMFDBACQ,AHNV3R7QZYE5QVEV7QEEBFO37HTA,AGSZW5C5GBRQXPA2MZ5XNZ7LCRQA","product_id":"B0B3D39RKV","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"Camera: 50MP Main Camera with Sony IMX766 and OIS, 8MP Ultrawide Camera with 120 degree FOV and 2MP mono lens with Dual LED Flash; 32MP Front (Selfie) Camera with Sony IMX615|Camera Features: AI Scene Enhancement, AI Highlight Video, Slow-motion captures, Dual-view Video, HDR, Nightscape, Portrait mode, Pano, Retouching and exciting filters|Display: 6.43 Inches; 90 Hz AMOLED Display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5; Resolution: 2400 X 1080 pixels; HDR 10+ Certified|Display Features: Ambient Display, AI colour enhancement and Dark mode|Operating System: OxygenOS based on Android 12|Processor: Mediatek Dimensity 1300|Battery & Charging: 4500 mAh with 80W SuperVOOC","review_title":"Really a Good Buy in this price range in 2022,Expected better Battery,Over-all a very balanced product.,Poor Battery life,Good,Temper glasses not istalle properly,It's 8 gb not working like 12gb,Apart from battery and sound quality, everything else is good.","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Jade-256GB-Storage/dp/B0B3D39RKV/ref=sr_1_75?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-75"}

Wires are great built and tangle free. The audio jack is compatible with almost all devices and its gold plated as well. I just didn't find the case. It was missing from my product. Though they have given 2 pairs of extra buds with different sizes. Overall it's a great wired in mic earphones. Go ahead and add to your cart. You won't regret it.,So first, let's talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 9/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. \uD83D\uDE0AAs you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️\uD83D\uDE43Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price point,NOT FOR HIGH BASS LOVERS,Everything was OK but as shown in the picture that you will get a case along with earphones,which was not there inside it(only earphone and some earplucks were there),This range very good product.if your budget under- 400 definitely you can bye this product.,Nice product,Product is good but the accessories like the pouch is not provided as mentioned in the description in the second delivery also, despite the return of first delivery of the product  for REPLACEMENT with pouch,product is good but needs to work on noise cancellation","rating":3.6,"discount_percentage":84.0,"product_name":"PTron Boom Ultima 4D Dual Driver, in-Ear Gaming Wired Headphones with in-line Mic, Volume Control & Passive Noise Cancelling Boom 3 Earphones - (Dark Blue)","discounted_price":299.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHDANFLZ6CRP3NUAFEG5KMPPZOFQ,AGP2HWARZOUPA3CD452G55XDOVCA,AFIXXDE6EGSPL7Z3V2HM2ONLKILQ,AHHC4X3NGUIXBDLGBNSGVCEBBWXA,AFMR2SQ4JJENHHZXWTUYOXFAFBDA,AFSN7XEYM3FYLA553HWSFJIWXNLQ,AFBFWTKCL3QGM752HHFGURNACKNA,AFH5MQTFGQYYKITYYBH5CFON3PEQ","product_id":"B08D75R3Z1","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|In-Ear","about_product":"In-ear Dual Driver Wired Earphones with Stereo Sound & Bass|In-line Remote Control with Mic, Music & Call Control.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.
