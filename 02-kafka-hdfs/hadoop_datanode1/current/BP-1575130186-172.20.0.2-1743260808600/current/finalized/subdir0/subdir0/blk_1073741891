But it can be a little disturbing if you are using it in dark. otherwise the best thing is, it doesn't need any installation headaches.Only reason I deducted one star is because this mouse is a little oversized for my hand.

I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.Sound quality :Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80%,Alright. So I have been using Boult ProBass Curve for over a month and would like to summarize my feedback in bullet-points to make it easy for the prospective buyers. I was thinking to buy a quality Bluetooth headset with a great performance at an affordable price for quite long and this is where my search ended. I was quite fed up of using cheap wired headsets as they used to go out of function or get snapped every now and then. Moreover, I found them getting entangled every other second making it really inconvenient to handle especially while travelling. Its that time I started feeling the need of a wireless headset and began my search. I took good time (months) to look for a good product. And, this is when I decided to purchase this item. Before purchase I devoted time to read the user's reviews (that I always do before making any purchase-small or big) and found myself convinced. Finally, I decided to go for it. Ok. So, no more essay writing :) Let me get straight to the key points:1. I bought this for 999 under Sale so saved INR 499. (it's a good saving. As Warrent Buffet says \"every penny saved is every penny earned\")2. This has great sound quality. I could not compare it against any other product because I don't have any other bluetooth headset with me :) But this will surely not let you down. It is very loud even at 80% volume level. You just cannot listen to at that level; forget about full volume. Bass is great but not outstanding to be honest but it does not disappoint either. Good thing is the sound does not distort even if you raise it to 100%. Excellent sound clarity!3. I am not a technocrat so cannot tell what are the characteristics of noise cancellation feature but you will not get to hear any external sound/noise or very very minimal that is not noticeable. So, this stands perfect at this point.4. Performs excellent while taking a call. You will a get a crystal clear voice when you make/take a call using this device. You will feel as if you are making calls directly from the mobile phone. In fact, it's even better at times when the voice from the other side is low. I really love the hands-free calling because I have to take long calls with the clients in my job.5. Battery backup is excellent!!! It can last anywhere from 10 to 11 hours. I have tested it rigorously in both audio and video usage. And, I mean it. I tested it for almost a month with day-wise log capture. Please see the detailed tracking at the end. It gets full charged in 2 hours approx.6. Bluetooth range is good. It covers a distance of 10 to 15 feet easily. It's quite enough if not good enough. My figures may be wrong. Beware! It's just my rough estimate. Haven't tested is rigorously.7. Design looks good and is very convenient to wear. The wires are adjustable as per need. This is a nice thing. Looks cool when you wear it around your neck. I chose Red color.8. Last but not the least. It comes with 1 year replacement warranty so you can sleep peacefully while enjoying your favorite music :)Judgement: Just go for it if you have a limited budget or don't want to spend a fortune on bluetooth headset. I was hesitant to spend anything beyond 1000 bucks on a bluetooth headset. It was my personal limitation.PS: Battery backup log:16 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 15 minutes approx in the morning song play + WebEx call with Suneel17 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the afternoon song play17 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play17 May 1 hour 20 minutes approx at night video play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play20 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the evening video play21 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play21 May start 22 minutes approx video play in the eveningBattery deadTotal battery time 11 hour 12 minutes*****************************************************22 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play22 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play23 May 1 hour 35 minutes approx in the morning song play23 May 1 hour approx in the evening video play24 May 1 hour 30 minutes approx in the morning song play24 May 1 hour 10 minutes approx in the evening video play26 May 27 minutes approx in the evening video play27 May 1 hour 29 minutes approx in the morning song play27 May 1 hour 27 minutes approx in the evening video playTotal time 11 hr 13 minutes*******************************************************28 May 1 hour 46 minutes approx in the morning song play28 May 1 hour 17 minutes approx in the evening video play29 May 1 hour 57 minutes approx in the morning song play29 May 1 hour in the evening video play30 May 1 hour 48 minutes approx in the morning song play30 May 55 minutes approx in the evening video play31 May 1 hour 24 minutes approx in the morning song play10 hour 07 minutesBattery discharged***************************************************31 May 1 hour 12 minutes approx in the evening video play03 June 1 hour 38 minutes approx song play in the morning03 June 1 hour 17 minutes approx video play in the evening04 June 1 hour 28 minutes approx song play in the morning04 June 1 hour 11 minutes approx video play in the evening05 June 23 minutes approx video play at night06 June 1 hour 47 minutes approx song play in the morning06 June 50 minutes approx video play in the eveningTotal time 9 hour 46 minutesBattery discharged******************************************************07 June 8.34 am start song play 10.06 end 1 hour 32 minutes approx07 June 6.47 pm start video play 7.53 pm end 1 hour 10 minutes approx08 June 11.38am start song play 12.37 59 minutes approx end 2.16pm start song play 4.04 pm 1 hour 48 minutes approx end10 June 8.37 am start song play 10.14 am end 1 hour 37 minutes approx10 June 6.27 pm start video play 7.46pm end 1 hour 19 minutes approx11 June 9.10am start song play 10.51am end 1 hour 41 minutes approx11 June 6.55 pm video play 7.46pm end 51 minutes approxBatter dischargedTotal time 10 hour 57 minutes approx,You have to purchase a headphone I recommend for this one. Under 1000 rupees best one..,No battery\uD83D\uDD0B backup and no flexible to use, they don't satisfied with provided features,I am writing this review after used of 30 days the product is really very good, sound quality, durability, battery performance is also very good,Overall its a fair product...Rs. 899...with all the features...Its perfect for daily commute since it has a very good battery life, it will last for 3 to 4 days easily.When it comes to the sound quality, i feel its not delivering as advertised which is obvious. It would be wrong to expect great sound from an overall product. You cant have everything at once. This is my personal opinion, since i am a music enthusiast and have experienced music from great headphones and ear phones.Other than that its worth trying, totally recommend this product if you daily travel for work and you are looking for a budget wireless earphone,Sound quality is not best,I LIKED THIS PRODUCT. ALREADY USING SINCE FEW DAYS. BATTERY BACK IS ALSO VERY GOOD.","rating":3.8,"discount_percentage":80.0,"product_name":"Boult Audio Probass Curve Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic with Ipx5 Water Resistant, 12H Battery Life & Extra Bass (Black)","discounted_price":899.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AH3XZBFRJ3T2YATYJK2CNTCARCCQ,AF2NVFDYXGX2BT7EPAUN7WYN3TDQ,AEVRTZ6HVKKV5CVX5XBW4QQLY3NA,AH3I5Z4W5KIRTITFSOBDBDSA23SQ,AG2DKHTMNEVMFCTBVNTH6NRRKTMA,AFDJVKMG73WAOX2CNN3VTFIT76UA,AHFPVRVDCUBDIONDU5U2DAT4CVJA,AHVSH7O4J2LW4S3YH4M76PPPVLSA","product_id":"B07LG59NPV","category":"Electronics|Headphones,Earbuds&Accessories|Headphones|In-Ear","about_product":"Long Battery Life - Curve is a powerhouse,Offers playback time of up to 12-15 hours for every charge.

It is sturdy BUT a bit on HEAVIER side. Can charge three phones at a time if you use the two USB and third Type C port as well for charging. The speed of charging is alright and appropriate. The ONE and only drawback I experienced is the weight of the Power-Bank itself, without this limitation it could be really amazing product to buy.,Bit heavy but does it’s job. Takes tooooooo much time to charge. Whatever mention in the description is not correct at all with regards to the powerbank charging.,I needed an extra power bank with a larger capacity. So this time I thought to give Ambrane a try, as i already have Honor & MI power banks (10000mAh ones). Though it was not a perfect match for MI or Honor ones, iit did live up to my expectations for the 1k range.•••••••••••••••••••\uD83C\uDF81 INSIDE BOX•••••••••••••••••••→ Powerbank→ MicroUSB cable→ Carry pouch (depends on which package you received, more below)→ User manual/Warranty card→ General leaflet→ Feedback leaflet••••••••••••••••••••••••\uD83D\uDCDD SOME DETAILS••••••••••••••••••••••••→ Mfg: October 2019→ Charging time: 9 Hrs 50 Min (via 10W charger, low battery indication to full charge)→ Backup: Was able to charge (5-100%) Redmi Note 5 pro's 4000Mah battery ~3.5 times with regular usage in between.••••••••••••➕ PROS••••••••••••1. High capacity power bank with dual input (micro USB or USB C).2. Dual output via 2 USB ports.3. Not a fast charge/quick charge device but has an output of 5V/2.4A (12W) which is good enough.4. Touch button for power checks or switch it on for charging device.5. It comes with a carry pouch. (more below on this part).6. Compact form factor & sturdy design with ABS body.•••••••••••••➖ CONS•••••••••••••1. It does not auto-start charging when the device is connected.2. Since it has a touch button instead of push-button, it activates accidentally switching it on every time during handling.3. There is a lot of conversion loss & backup is slightly less for a 20000mAh power bank.▶ Cons are significant enough to reduce 1 star. There is scope for improvement (points 1 & 2) in this product in the same range. So ★★★★ device.••••••••••••••••••••\uD83D\uDCA1 LED STATUS••••••••••••••••••••→ 1st/2nd/3rd/4th LED blinking (while charging power bank): Status of charge in terms of no of LEDs blinking→ 1/2/3/4 LEDs solid white (while charging other devices): Status of remaining battery in terms of no of LEDs→ One blinking (while charging other devices): Low battery→ All 4 LED solid glow: Battery fully charged•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••\uD83D\uDD0A AMBRANE BOX DEBATE•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••1. When i first received this power bank it came in a small box (approx 12x9x3cm, Mfg: Aug 2019) with everything forced in congested space. The issue i had in this one was that it came with open seal & no poly wrap around product box as if it was a used product or was tampered in between. So was skeptical about the authenticity of the product and ordered a replacement right away.→ This one had USB C cable but no carry pouch.2. When replacement came, it came in a poly-wrapped bigger box (22x10x4 cm, Mfg: Oct 2019) with an outer sleeve and main box inside with a hologram seal. Maybe Ambrane changed the packaging. The hologram seal here was intact but was also not applied properly to secure the opening. Looked like it was applied with an open box. So its presence was useless.→ This one came with Micro USB cable and a carry pouch.••••••••••••••••••••••••\uD83D\uDC5C CARRY POUCH••••••••••••••••••••••••→ As per my analysis carry pouch comes with the latest October lot which comes in a bigger box and was unavailable in earlier lot with a small box.→ Carry pouch size was appropriate for power bank and i had no trouble inserting power bank in it. (Some users reported it having a smaller opening but i had no trouble with it and found it to be a proper fit. Neither loose nor tight.→ Its soft nylon meshed pouch and is a nice addon.••••••••••••••••\uD83C\uDFC6 VERDICT••••••••••••••••▶ At the price point its not a bad deal. Its a midway path b/w low quality and high-quality ones. You can very well go for Ambrane, as it makes good quality & durable power banks. Rest, nothing is perfect in this world. For this thing only, 10 days replacement policy from Amazon and 1-year warranty from Ambrame is available.▶ If one can extend the budget by a few hundred, MI power bank will be a better option with a metallic body & better quality overall. I have MI, Honor & Ambrane power bank and their overall rating will be (from low to high) Ambrane → Honor → MI,I am putting up this review after 1 day of usage. This is the second power bank i have bought from Ambrane India overall third power bank for my family. Before to this i have bought their PP-30 30000 mah model and also has MI 2i 20000 mah power bank both were really good, here i am putting together all the pros and cons which i am able to find after 1 day of usage and also a little bit of comparison. My dad uses Redmi note 7, my mom has MI A1 and i am using Redmi note 3Pros:-- Dual Input Type C and Micro USB this is the foremost and primary reason of choosing this power bank over MI or other brands as you don't need to carry two cables if your phone has type c input which in my family 2 out of 3 has  the same- Easy to carry and hold as it is very compact is size i must say in comparison to MI or Ambrane PP-30- Solid and sturdy built- 20000 mah capacity with same lithium polymer batteries these are safer then lithium ion batteries, this i came to know while buying this product-  ₹200 cheaper price than MI- Touch button at the top to know the power status (this is something unique)-  It took less than 1 hour to charge my redmi note 3 from 13% to 100% at 2 cell battery indicator, which is pretty good and almost equivalent to my wall charger best part same time and charging speed in Delhi Metro- I don't know either it is pro or con, both of my other power banks supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 Technology while this power bank supports only fast charging at 2.4 Amp, but i feel this has charged my phone better and faster than MI power bank itself. I know a phone must also supports quick charge technology for fast charging but when i use quick charge on my dad's Redmi note 7 (which supports QC 4.0) either from MI power bank or Ambrane PP-30 power bank it kind of heats up the phone, also it fluctuates the power and automatically switches between Quick Charge and fast charging which affects your battery life, so it is safer to charge the phone at optimum current at 2.4 ampCons:-- Very stuffy packaging, it looks like the power bank has been forced fully stuffed inside the box- It has some adhesive tape at the top i don't know why ? which, when you remove it, puts scratches on the top, be careful while removing the same- No torch light, their PP-30 have it- only micro cable inside the box,Definitely heavy but I knew this. I will recommend this, as it has 2 slots so we can charge two phones.,Nice product,Power backup is good.. but the USB cable provided is very bad. It stopped working after few months of usage,Everything is good but the battery don’t last that long when use for charging two device.","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":28.0,"product_name":"Ambrane 20000mAh Power Bank with 20W Fast Charging, Triple Output, Power Delivery, Type C Input, Made in India, Multi-Layer Protection, Li-Polymer + Type C Cable (Stylo-20k, Black)","discounted_price":1799.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AFAKEZV7KMVT2SGF4KYWXGQRIW4A,AE33MAZWYRVAAICGNACZAIWACK7Q,AGBITVO2DOMNZU6DB4QF2WXXELLA,AFNFUGSKHFEN7D2XJICFYQIK62VQ,AH3HGPTMWGF4FTGDEKIODKTU5RCA,AEMKH7NSGFU5YGYOC54RHG54WHXQ,AGUTBT3QDFUJECX3SI4FAX647CZA,AGZJITIDEQNYDGVCPZDNXLBYDYYA","product_id":"B07RD611Z8","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|MobileAccessories|Chargers|PowerBanks","about_product":"Massive 20000mAh Lithium Polymer capacity allows you to charge your devices multiple times.
