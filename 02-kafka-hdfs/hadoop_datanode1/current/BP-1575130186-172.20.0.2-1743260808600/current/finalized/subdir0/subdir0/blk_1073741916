Also this cannot be used to boot from, so its just an accessory to transfer data to and from computer in easy way, BUT one cannot boot into this like one can using USB drive.,It is very handy, speed is awesome. Working flawlessly but the build quality is very delicate, they should improve the build quality.

I bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. Wanted to buy this Qubo camera and give it a try as this is Made in India and from the famous Hero Group. The product did live up to my expectation!!Here are my observations:Pros:- Excellent in performance.- Accurate in motion detection.- Can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- LED turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- Crystal clear vision even in night.Cons:- Had to struggle a bit in configuring it. The usability of the app is not easy to understand. Figured out the right options to use after few trials. Hence giving 4 star rating.- The LED doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.Keep it up Hero Group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,The Qubo 360 camera is great. I am able to set it up for my kittens whom I can be assured once I leave my house for some time. The best feature is the two way talk in which we can communicate via the camera itself.,Product is very easy to install as well as setup and use. It is excellent motion detection and also has person detection which is not available in this price range.,Camera quality and clarity are good. Also having excellent features. This camera was delivered on time and the tech support is also good. :)The only missing feature is that this camera lacks storage to external nvr.,I bought this model for my living room, it’s very decent and easy to install. Working very well.,It is I goo product I  using It and I hai be over 1 month and I have no issues with this product,Target has to fixed as it observed motion and went over there( on wall) it get stuck over there as no motion now next.,Great product.

It was also delivered in record time.,Good for perfect printout,The ink is 20% missing. Otherwise it is a genuine product. Very good printing and no problem at all.

But, the ink bottles are 1/4 empty, though the bottles are big and of large diameter, so I guess it contains 135 ml ink.The mouth of the bottle is big and a 10 ml syringe easily gets inside. I used this ink to refill my canon PG47 cartridges. I am surprise with the print quality and count of prints.
