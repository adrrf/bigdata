Package was in good condition, thanks amazon. Was installed within a day. Writing this review after using the tv for more than a week.1. picture quality is good.2. Sound could be better. Dosnt' mean its bad.3. connectivity is good.4. No issues with software or hardware till now.Overall a good product in this budget. Once again thanks Amazon and LG.,This is good smart tv,I wanted to get display for my PS4.  I was contemplating between a monitor and TV.  Since,  there is no need to get display with high resolution, I opted for this TV.  I have been using this TV for 3 months now.  Below are my observations when using this TV as a secondary TV or gaming TV.Pros:1.  This TV comes with the software from the bigger OLED TV of LG meaning,  to some extent better upscaling.2.  Since I am using primarily as a gaming TV, I love the Game mode.  You can truly see the difference when you play with and without Game mode.  Pic and responses are shaper and faster with Game mode active.3.  You can connect Bluetooth headset to TV.  Great when watching movies as a secondary option.4.  LG service is the best!!!  The come probably the next day,  install the TV (wall mount) for free - Really quick and clean.Cons:1.  No headphone Jack on the TV2.  You can connect a Bluetooth headphones to the TV.  However, for gamers,  the game mode is disabled when TV sound output is through headphones.  However, there is a work around for this.,,It is a good product from LG in range of 15k.Pros:1. Bluetooth support for my wireless earphone2. Audio output is enough for room size of 12×12.3. Wall mount installation is free of cost from LG.4. Smart remote in this range is really appreciable from LG. Doubt samsung provide smart remote this in this range.5. Picture quality is decent.,,,I love LG product and happy to buy this product with 15.5K. It's very good smart TV  with amazing features consist of Good processor, Smart Remote,  Good LCD screen and sound quality is also good.Recommended to purchase.","rating":4.3,"discount_percentage":33.0,"product_name":"LG 80 cm (32 inches) HD Ready Smart LED TV 32LQ576BPSA (Ceramic Black)","discounted_price":15990.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AE4KODYP3MGRZS2JI6V7ZWVI5CHA,AEEETBDP73H6344UQ5FJSUBNR63A,AEHKKIS4WKMVCADF6Y3HMR5IRM7Q,AHQWAOSKNRUVK7GN5FZJL3UYLV2A,AFJDUYYD5BCY5PU522GYHMVIS4VQ,AFQRUDMIIMRA32Y3JBUQNWFREEUQ,AGSMSIDW4O7QLQGWYZQQMDHWGR4Q,AED3V5KQXHYOPY3IL2CUQITIZFHQ","product_id":"B09YL9SN9B","category":"Electronics|HomeTheater,TV&Video|Televisions|SmartTelevisions","about_product":"Resolution: HD Ready (1366x768) | Refresh Rate: 60 hertz | Resolution Upscaler | 178 Degree wide viewing angle|Connectivity: 2 HDMI ports to connect set top box, Blu Ray players, gaming console | 1 USB ports to connect hard drives and other USB devices | 2-Way Bluetooth|Sound: 10 Watts Output | Dolby Digital Plus Sound Configuration | AI Sound | Virtual Surround 5.1 | Bluetooth Surround Ready | AI Acoustic Tuning|Smart TV Features: α5 Gen 5 AI Processor | Web OS Operating System | Wi-Fi | Magic Remote | Full Web Browser | Screen Share | Game Optimizer | Built-in Alexa | Google Assistant | AI Functions | Works with Apple AirPlay & Homekit | HDR 10 Pro | 8 GB Storage | Supported Apps: Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ Hotstar, Sony Liv, Zee5, Apple TV and more|Display: LED Panel | HD Ready Digital Video Format | Slim & Stylish Design|Warranty Information: 1 Year LG India Comprehensive Warranty and additional 1 year Warranty is applicable on panel/module from the date of purchase|Installation : For requesting installation/wall mounting/demo of this product once delivered, please directly call LG support (Please visit LG Website for Toll Free Numebrs) and provide product's model name as well as seller's details mentioned on the invoice","review_title":"Good tv and features in this budget.,Genuine products,Offers a lot of functionality for 32 inch,Best Buy under Rs. 16000/-,A perfect TV for your room,Super \uD83D\uDC4C \uD83D\uDC4D,Nice,It's amazing with this price 15.5K.","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/LG-inches-Ready-32LQ576BPSA-Ceramic/dp/B09YL9SN9B/ref=sr_1_125?qid=1672909130&s=electronics&sr=1-125"}

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one.

That's better quality.,This is one of the good product in this price range. Quality is okay,Using it for my laptop cooling pad. Overall build looks sturdy, but longevity cannot confirm. Also, YOU CANNOT CONNECT 2 PCs USING A MALE TO MALE USB. THAT IS NOT HOW IT WORKS. Stop writing negative reviews after using this cable for something that it was NOT intended for.Can confirm that it is ~1.2m as most other products and not 1.5m as the seller claims both in title and on stickers on the product.No review mentions this. But I needed a 1.5m length for perfect use. So disappointed as I have to rotate the cooling pad and use it (cable falls short by around 15cm).,It works well. The cable is soft and flexible.
