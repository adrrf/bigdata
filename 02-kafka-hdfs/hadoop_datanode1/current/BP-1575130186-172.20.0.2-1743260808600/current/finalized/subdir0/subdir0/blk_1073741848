But it didn't clearly suit the Samsung monitor I have. I had to remove a specific part behind the monitor and adjusted this wall mount. Till now no issue.,Product is good. I am using Benq ex2780q monitor. Holds well enough but there are only 2 places to screw it in. This makes you doubt sometimes weather this can hold up the weight of the monitor. I have been using it for the past 2 months and haven't faced any issue.Another problem with this montioe is the rubber that is used for rotating the montioe is cheap and gets broken initially only. But replaced with proper nuts and this worked fine for meFinal verdict: good monitor wall mount easily taking 5kg of weight on it.Could have been better if the rubber material and count of screw holes in the wall mount be more,Great product at reasonable rate. Very easy to install. Very sturdy product. Never feel like monitor will fall down.\uD83D\uDC4D\uD83C\uDFFB,Self install a bit difficult.

Side on design is very practical.Sturdy build. Well worth the money.,Very useful,Very nice in this price range,The cable quality is great and its built well, both sides are L shaped connectors ( 1 side of the cable should have been regular as L shaper port blocks other ports and if you have a mobile stand you can't use this cable.Its very bad for data transfer even a 1 gb file takes 5 or more minutes.Great for charging, supports fast charging as well. If you want a cable just for charging your phone its great.Updating review after getting a replacement, now it doesn't even fast charge my phone. Returned it.,Product is good.But sometimes there are little bit charging problem seen.It shows disconnected from charging while it is plugged in.BTW, some weeks later it eaten by our goat\uD83D\uDE02Then I bought one new.,Best quality cable at best price,Short review: Go for it if you are looking for a C2C charging cable at 60W or less. Sturdy and stylish with an added advantage of 90° connectors.[Deal price: ₹139]Long review:I have been using Portronics products lately and I have to appreciate the quality and innovation they bring to the end users.Products I own from Portronics: • My Buddy k3 • Brillo 3 • Power Plate 7 • Mobot one • Clamp M • Konnect LAll the products I bought from Portronics not just met my expectations but they performed beyond that. It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsung's original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery (60W).It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90° ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won't come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict: I would definitely recommend this Type-c to Type-c cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less.","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":50.0,"product_name":"Portronics Konnect L 60W PD Type C to Type C Mobile Charging Cable, 1.2M, Fast Data Sync, Tangle Resistant, TPE+Nylon Braided(Grey)","discounted_price":249.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AHX6CSQGEBRWNFP27HRO6OHTKYXQ,AEOBGCGXCAHBMUOYKGJIISS7B2HQ,AHGAPUHNPLZZD7NW74AQPOEYPJIQ,AGKTH6UCTEE5C23YTWWUHXU2RUGQ,AHT5LZB5FO2RBAS6HFZPMSB47FJA,AGSBLSMYBGR27VKHLCERTQ4SXJQQ,AHJXXJ6QZSP5VH7GEUWUNOBETADQ,AE2YKXGI2XFOVDHNL6FF2RQAZ55A","product_id":"B09Q8WQ5QJ","category":"Computers&Accessories|Accessories&Peripherals|Cables&Accessories|Cables|USBCables","about_product":"[1.2 M LONG DURABLE CABLE] : The Konnect L is about 1.2 M long and this feature allows for maximum convenience of the user.
