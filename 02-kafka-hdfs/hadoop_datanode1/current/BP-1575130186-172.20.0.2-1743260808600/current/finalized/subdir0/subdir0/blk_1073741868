The Boat Xtend Smartwatch comes with a stylish design resembling the Apple watch. Moreover, it has built-in Amazon Alexa support, SpO2 tracking, stress tracking, and much more. Coming in a budget segment, is it worth it? Should you buy this smartwatch? If you too have such queries, then there is nothing to worry about. It is a detailed review of Boat Xtend Smartwatch which will clear all your doubts about it.ContentsBox ContentDesign, Build & ComfortDisplayWatch UI And FeaturesAlexa SupportWatch FacesBoat Wave AppAccuracyBatteryFinal WordsBuy Now:Box ContentBoat Xtend box contentSmartwatch in black&gold colourCharging clipUser Manual and warranty cardDesign, Build & ComfortWhen buying a smartwatch, one always thinks about its design and look. Apart from features, design and build is another major aspect one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. The boat has worked on its design this time which brings it to a premium side in terms of look. The design is inspired by the Apple Watch 3, but it cannot be compared to that. Obviously, in every aspect, Apple Watch 3 would be much better than the Boat Xtend Smartwatch. Redmi Watch as well as Amazfit Bip U Pro has the same shape and design, but the build quality is much premium on this one.Boat Xtend design and buildI personally don’t like the color scheme of this Boat Xtend Smartwatch. The black color variant comes with a golden color metallic frame. I believe the gold color would fade away after some time. There are three other color variants, which also don’t look stylish as this one. However, that is my personal opinion on the color scheme, so maybe you might find the color scheme to be good.Boat Xtend designThe watch has 5ATM water resistance. It has silicon straps, which are quite comfortable. The straps are good quality straps which you will find comfortable with regular usage.DisplayComing to the display, the watch has a 42mm square shape display. What you see on this one is a TFT panel. The screen has big bezels, however, the good part is that the screen goes completely back when it is off, so you won’t notice the bezels, and the screen quality won’t feel cheap at all. It doesn’t have an always-on display, but we cannot complain about that. The watch offers a screen on time of up to 20 seconds and up to 12 levels of brightness control.Boat Xtend display qualityI find the display quality of the Boat Xtend Smartwatch to be better than the previous smartwatch from Boat. View angle is good on this one, and you can clearly see content on this smartwatch even in the sunlight. The color on this one is not very saturated, but this isn’t something that we can complain about in this price range.Watch UI And FeaturesThe UI of this smartwatch is clean and easy to use. There is a single button on the watch which works as the power/off button as well as the back button. Moreover, the display is a touchscreen display that works without any problem. There isn’t much animation on the bar menu, and the navigation is simple, so you won’t find it difficult to use. However, the watch may lag a bit. The company has done cost-cutting in terms of the processor, that’s why you may find it to lag a bit, but it is OK, and not a big deal at the price point you get it.Boat Xtend UiThe watch offers all the basic fitness features such as daily activity (which includes total steps walked, calories burnt, and time), heart rate, sleep tracking, stress tracking breath training, SpO2 training, meditation, find my phone, and music control. Apart from that, there are 14 different support modes on this watch. I tried a few of them, and they worked fine. The watch notifies you of the incoming calls, messages received, and various other notifications in detail.Boat Xtend smartwatch reviewAlexa SupportThe main highlight of the Boat Xtend is the Amazon Alexa Support. The watch has an in-built microphone, and you can access it by long-pressing the back button. Do note that you can only do some basic tasks with Alexa on the watch like setting an alarm, setting a timer, and such. Well, it is a good thing to have Alexa on a watch, but you won’t find it very useful. Probably you will use it for a day or two out of excitement, and then you won’t prefer using it because it only does some basic tasks. So, even if Boat missed this feature, it won’t be a problem.Boat Xtend Alexa supportWatch FacesThe next cool thing about this Boat Smartwatch is the watch faces you get on this one. You get more than 100 watch faces on the watch, and probably more watch faces will be added to it. Moreover, you can also set a custom watch face as well.Boat Xtend watch facesBoat Wave AppYou will have to download the Boat Wave App to use the watch. The app is available for both Android as well as iOS devices. You won’t be seeing bugs on the app, and it works perfectly. I haven’t noticed any problem with connectivity like frequent disconnection. The interface of the Boat Wave is clean and simple. You will get all the fitness-related options and all the watch settings on the app itself.Boat Xtend boat wave appAccuracyAccuracy is one of the important aspects that one should take care of when buying a smartwatch. So talking about the accuracy, I tested everything on this watch, from normal walking to running, sleeping, and much more, and I find the results to be accurate.Boat Xtend accuracy testCompared to Realme or Redmi Watch, the result was the same on all of them. So, there is no problem with the accuracy. I don’t find the results to be accurate on most of the budget fitness trackers, but yes, this smartwatch is accurate in terms of fitness tracking, sleep tracking, and everything it does.Boat Xtend accuracyComparing it to the Noise watch which we tried recently, the stress level as well as the SpO2 tracking is much more accurate on this one. It also has the option to track the menstrual cycle in women.Boat Xtend accuracyBatteryYou get to see a 300mAH battery on this one, which the company claims to last 7 days. However, if you use most of the features of the watch, then the battery will last about two and a half days. If you keep the brightness low, then the battery will last about 3-4 days. I find the battery life to be a downside of the watch. It comes with magnet hook charging support.Final WordsBoat Xtend Smartwatch is a decent smartwatch from the Boat. It offers all the basic fitness features you will find on a budget fitness tracker, a good display, Alexa support, good design and build, and much more. The smartwatch at this price is quite good. Personally, what I didn’t like about this smartwatch is its color scheme. However, if you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for it. Overall the watch is good with nothing to dislike about it except for the battery life. The battery life on this one is quite low. The company claims it to have a battery life of 7 days, but with regular usage, it will last for 2-3 days. If you are looking for a good smartwatch under Rs.5000, and you can adjust with the battery life, and you like the color scheme, then I would recommend you to go for this smartwatch. It offers all the features that should be there in a smartwatch under Rs.5000.,Pros:1. Premium build quality with matte finishing- sturdy polycarbonate frame, good soft silicone straps that r absolutely flush with the body of the watch. Attractive, trendy colours.2. Heart Rate (except heart rate spikes in weight training), Pedometer(steps counter) are accurate but SPO2 is off by +/- 2% when compared to Pulse Oximeter readings. But most smart watches offer the same accuracy. Sleep tracking is accurate only for bed time & wake up time, duration but stages of sleep are inaccurate. Light, deep sleep, waking detected but no REM sleep detected. Sleep data from the watch synchronises smoothly with Boat Wave app. Issues warning msg if watch not worn on hand properly and does not detect data of surfaces.3. Large (1.69\"), clear bright, sharp LCD IPS display even in the sun.4. Touch not smooth, experienced jitters. UI also lags at times & after attaching the tempered glass sometimes some functions require 02-03 taps to work. But acceptable scrolling response if finger moved diagonally instead of vertically.5. In app GPS works superbly. Excellent route tracking on the map. This feature is not advertised in their description.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is good if mobile is kept in close proximity(7m). The Boat Wave app must remain running in the background at all times.7. Definitely splash proof though did'nt take the risk of submerging the watch.8. All notifications are working, no problem with call alerts or SMS msgs or social media app notifications. No lags at all though there is provision for a 3 sec lag which can be turned on.9. Alexa works superbly but since there is no speaker, info is displayed on the screen. My Wipro Smart Bulb, FireTV stick can be controlled easily using the inbuilt Alexa on the watch. Alexa can do mathematical calculations, currency conversions, even foreign language translations, apart from supplying info on anything under the sun. But ofcourse, Alexa cannot make calls. Alexa can set alarm, timer also.10. Sedentary alert, drinking water reminder, stress alert, menstrual cycle alert, alarms, timers function well.11. Boat Wave app connects easily & no lags observed. Data syncs smoothly with Google Fit app. Excellent health reports and motivational rewards system in the form of badges. But settings can be changed only through the app and the watch needs to be restarted for the new settings to be effective.12. Training, Sports modes r good.13. Guided Breathing mode is also good.14. Find my phone works well.15. Extremely stylish, light weight & comfortable for all day wear.16. 07 watch faces available in the device with 04 preset which cannot be deleted. The rest can be changed from the Boat Wave app.Cons:1. Lacks vibration intensity control.2. Lacks Camera control shutter. But can't figure out its use as my handset accepts both voice commands & gestures to click pics.3. No quick reply messages for notifications/call alerts.4. No call acceptance or silencing feature. A work around can be if bluetooth handset is connected at the same time.5. SPO2 is not accurate and sometimes freezes at 97%. But this is common in all smart watches.6. Battery does'nt last more than 03 days if continuous HR measurement is turned on. Otherwise easily lasts for 7 days.7. Watch faces are very childish. Expected better quality designs. Company can easily improve on this in their next update.8. Amazon Prime only replacement, no refund policy is not good. At least colour change should be allowed once.9. Music control feature does not display the title of the song.10. No BP monitoring or temperature monitoring feature. Smart watches usually do not provide reliable BP data.11. No calling feature. But it does'nt matter as most don't want conversations to be public.12. A bit large for narrow wrists, band @22 mm is a bit wide.13. Company should provide a tempered glass protector. No mention of protective glass on the display mentioned. Have attached a Scot tempered glass purchased separately.14. There are actually only 10 sports modes. Boat has bloated the list with Indoor-Outdoor combi of 4 sports (Walking, Running, Swimming, Cycling).15. There is no light sensor. Auto brightness is only time dependant but works well.Was a wedding anniversary gift for my wife who liked it very much even the colour- the evergreen, classic gold-black. Overall the best smart watch with Alexa built in, available at the budget price point of under Rs 3000. An excellent Fitness Tracker but average Health Monitor.,\uD83D\uDC4D,Plz add calling feature with this,Otherwise it is ok,Good,It's little expensive but okkk,","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":62.0,"product_name":"boAt Xtend Smartwatch with Alexa Built-in, 1.69” HD Display, Multiple Watch Faces, Stress Monitor, Heart & SpO2 Monitoring, 14 Sports Modes, Sleep Monitor, 5 ATM & 7 Days Battery(Pitch Black)","discounted_price":2999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AE6CROVUGPHR7BRT5JASNRWSPBVQ,AHL5MROK5N63VXVBMKVZJ3GNB7ZQ,AFPCHRP52XCWFQ625WEACPUTXO7A,AHIUG7OVT3SRXSCNUZPNKHTQH57Q,AGVPDZ73B6LF5BBIZ3YGX2WRGJ2Q,AEQEIF23AAXTOBTLBICNMLFK662A,AGDPIWXL6XEBCXAGBYTER5S2JZ4Q,AFPDHMQW4AYII5KK7CLG4MMTIAHA","product_id":"B096VF5YYF","category":"Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches","about_product":"Alexa- Alexa built-in Voice Assistant that sets reminders, alarms and answers questions from weather forecasts to live cricket scores at your command!|Screen Size- ;1.69\" big square colour LCD display with a round dial features complete capacitive touch experience to let you take control, effortlessly.|Watch Faces- Multiple watch faces with customizable options to match your OOTD, every day!|Brightness- The ambient light display allows automatic adjustment of brightness on the watch, suited to your environment|HR & SpO2- The watch comes with a stress monitor that reads your HR to indicate stress levels.It also monitors your heart rate and SpO2 (blood oxygen levels) to keep a tab on your overall health.|Sleep Monitor- Track all stages of sleep every night and keep a tab on your sleep health with the sleep monitoring feature on the watch.|Sports Friendly- Its 14 sports mode and 5 ATM dust, splash and sweat resistance makes it the perfect fitness companion to have.","review_title":"NOt worth the money,Good budget smart watch with Alexa,\uD83D\uDC4D,Good product,I don't have flashlight function and speaker is not working,Nice,It's little cost,Wach not working","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/boAt-Smartwatch-Multiple-Monitoring-Resistance/dp/B096VF5YYF/ref=sr_1_89?qid=1672895770&s=electronics&sr=1-89"}

Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.Good:- Screen quality- Battery life- Looks and the metallic frame- Call clarity- BT calling at the price- Reasonably accurate sensorsBad:- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.,Boat wave call watch is best for budget.Call is too good and sound quality is also too good.Battery is good.Totally the watch is good for range.,It's good value for money smart watch.Light weight.

I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting.

I am not a person who believes to burn money for phones. My requirement was a phone that has good network reception, good wifi reception, a balanced software, good battery life, good screen that don't strain eyes, a good hardware, 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a charger. i don't need 5G network because 5G drains battery a lot and 5G spends too much data. I don't watch movie or YT on mobile network and I wonder how many does watch FHD, 2K, 4K videos over mobile network. For downloading documents, social networks, banking apps 4G is more than enough.In my budget I found all phones have 4gb RAM. Realme Narzo 50 was 9999/- during GIF and had all those features along with a good processor and another one was Redmi note 11. But I found that if I can extend my budget a little more with all coupons and bank offer I can get a Redmi note 11 with 6gb RAM at 11749/- . 6gb RAM is always preferred over 4gb RAM because nobody knows whether with future updates the OS would demand more RAM or not, also the softwares may require more RAM as time passes away. So this was the only option I knew then available.Redmi note 11 has AMOLED Display, I am not bothered with 60Hz, 90Hz,120Hz. I keep the refresh rate at 60Hz and display works without zero lag or stutter. All my Desktop screen has 60Hz refresh rate and I am happy with them so why do I need a 90 Hz screen? I think this is all just gimmick marketed by companies and online reviewers. The display has excellent colour reproduction capability and colours look rich. You can adjust colour temperature to warm or cool but I think standard is fine for me. Also you can calibrate display colours in settings but I think you don't need that. Display size is 6.43 inch it could have been better if it were 6.7 inch. I prefer big display phone. Redmi note 12 has that big display. A plastic screen protector is pre applied on screen and I am happy with that. The screen protector feels smooth and fingerprints can be easily removed by wiping with a damp cloth. The screen has a punch hole camera which looks good.This phone duel speakers. One is more powerful at bottom and another on top. But i think the second speaker is actually earpiece which amplifies while watching movies or YT. Bottom speaker is louder than top speaker and volume is good. What more do you expect from such tiny speakers!The phone has excellent wifi and mobile network reception. Many have complained about poor wifi connectivity but from my experience I can say my phone and Wifi modem stays at different floor, still I get good signal, and never disconnected. Voice over mobile network sounds nice and clear and the other party can hear you well and clear. However because the second speaker is an extension of earphone piece the sound will leak if the other person is shouting over phone.The phone has 5000mAh battery and comes with 33W charger which is a bonus at this price point. The battery gives long backup. With good mobile network you can use it for 3 days without charging using basic features, like phone, sms, email, FB, WA etc. But I charge it regularly and battery charge never drops below 70%.The phone has SD680 processor which is more that enough for basic tasks and performs well without any lag. The experience is butter smooth. However the apps get automatically cleared from RAM which I like because I don't have to clear RAM manually. However after Android 12 update the RAM hold App for longer time but eventually cleared. SD 680 doesn't heat up and it is very energy efficient. Because of that battery drains very little and 33W charger charges phone within 30 mins for my usage. The cable is USB A to C and feels good.This phone has IR blaster so in your home office you can control AC or other supported gadgets with this phone when remote is unavailable.This phone has DDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage. The RAM is 6GB and can be expanded additional 1 GB as virtual RAM by occupying storage. But I have disabled that option from settings because it increases SSD life. This has 2 Sim + SD card slot. Which is a great. Both SIM have VoLTE and carrier aggregation.The phone has beautiful back and colour is attractive. Some people may complain about plastic But remember plastic back phone has better network reception than metal or glass back phones. And I have no problem with plastic. I don't think plastic back makes your phone or you look cheap. I am happy with plastic back. The phone also gives a TPU cover and the cover however yellowing after i month. This is inherent chemistry of TPU, and no one can prevent this chemical degradation. How ever can be slowed by not exposing it to sunlight.The fingerprint scanner is excellent it works flawlessly. The touch screen is excellent too.However I dont like some of the preinstalled apps. Some can be uninstalled a few can't especially Mi pay and getapps from mi store. I don't like them. However I like the pre installed security app. There is no ad in notification  and all can be easily disabled. Camera at back is good and sufficient for me however the front camera is not good. Does not show pictures like 8MP camera. I have added some pictures clicked by Redmi note 11 back camera. MiUi is fluid and has many user friendliness like OneUI. MiUI is now free of Bugs and has an extremely polished version that will please the user.So I give Redmi 11 a score of 9.5/10. This is an excellent phone the I got at 11749/- during Great Indian festival. I recommend anyboy with basic usage to buy this phone. This phone is not for gamers or people who watch 2K, $k videos or shoot such things. This is not or those who are crazy for 5G. Otherwise this phone will fulfil your every requirement in this price segment.,50 days usage...1. Good battery LIFE. Bqest for day-day use. 33W charger also good.2. Best display but should've 120hz instead of 90.3. Sturdy in-hand feel4. Stereo speaker is loud and crisp(65-35 split).5. Camera above average... But good concerning the price.6. Buggy UI(minor) as expected. But ui13 all way better than bloody MIUI 12.5.7. 4G chipset SD 680, which is fine... 4G+ always available.8. Some minor issue with WiFi reception. Don't know may be they will fix it through OTA.*** THIS PHONE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO CLICKS PHOTOS HERE & THERE, CASUAL GAMER & BINGE WATCHERS OF WEB SHOWS/MOVIES... \"NOT INTENDED FOR HEAVY GAMING\"NOT FOR PUBG, COD LOVERS.,The first look of this starbust design is eye catchy...no word to express its design,in hand feel and and it's all physical dimension. the second this which impress me, it's battery backup.....even you playing game hardly for a long time....it gives you sufficient battey backup and charging speed also 33W, is also a good deal at this price. The third impressive factor is it's dual speaker....I have an another phone of 40k and the sound quality is almost same as it. Media playback experience is also enhanced by it's amoled display, very colour charming display...... literally the display quality is unbeatable. The camera notch and dual speaker increase the media playing experience. Other Performance like gaming is also good at this price point. Fingerprint button is also very responsive. All other things and features are good to the price point.Only one thing is very disappointing bcoz the hype of its camera that company shows is very up to the mark and professional photography but the camera is lower grade...even my old Redmi Y2 which I exchanged with this, had better camera than this ....So plz I request you to all .... don't buy this for camera....just don't. The images are shown of camera pictures on the website is illustration according to me......I don't recommend you to buy this phone as your camera phone.If you are non camera user then you will surely go for it.Pros- design, in-hand feel, battery and charging, amoled display,dual speakerCons- camera\uD83D\uDE24\uD83D\uDE24,Quite a smooth daily driver phone. The overall experience has been satisfactory, camera's good, durability also seems to be good, I've dropped it quite a few times & the gorilla glass 5 seems to be holding up. 120hz feels great. Charging speed is good too, nothing mind-blowing though. Battery life is decent. Lasts quite a bit, but since I keep it in the 120hz mode all the time, it's a little less for me. But I don't have any problem with battery life for now.,It does what the description says.Camera quality not upto the mark, compared to other redmi mobiles. Even A3 model clicks better pics.Finger print sensor is same as that of the lock  button. You need to press the lock button every time to get the fingerprint read.Volume is good for both call and streaming.Fast charging but charger gets heated soon.Battery back up is good, unless you don't do heavy gaming and all day video sreaming.Dual app and dual space option is missing.Light weight and good video resolution.Overall good for learning students for online sessions and persons with less need for photography & gaming.,I bought this for my dad and it's working good for him, if you are planning to give it to your parents or elderly people in your family just install third party launcher and hide unnecessary app aslo turn off spamming notification and lockscreen ads overall good Phone for elders or first time smartphone user.,Phone is good, but i facing weird bugs due to software issues. After that i manually installed latest global software then working fine.When i was using indian firmware, after the update the phone got into bootloop every 10 sec, but after manual installation its working fine","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":28.0,"product_name":"Redmi Note 11 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)|90Hz FHD+ AMOLED Display | Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 680-6nm | 33W Charger Included","discounted_price":12999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AEJLOEHISUISLO2Z4RE2TO2V6NGA,AEJ4UYFD3M2WGB3WEQJOZ3GGJY7Q,AFJ3CVFC3MO2Z3MYQTCELWT4TTKQ,AEEBECR65JN34YC7NEJIFAQB67TQ,AE5XN2CICXIBA4IK6F4ONOJ6TOCA,AGUZQN2LWKQXLXBJO2NRTXGV7EUA,AHWQSD5JHCOHW7JYN7F52ABQCJQA","product_id":"B09QS8V5N8","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"Display: 90Hz FHD+ (1080x2400) AMOLED display; 16.33 centimeters (6.43 inch); 20:9 aspect ratio|Camera: 50 MP Quad Rear camera with 8MP Ultra-wide, 2MP Macro and Portrait lens| 13 MP Front camera|Battery: 5000 mAh large battery with 33W Pro fast charger in-box and Type-C connectivity|Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 680 Octa-core; 6nm processor; Up to 2.4GHz clock speed|Memory, Storage & SIM: 4GB RAM | 64GB UFS 2.2 storage expandable up to 512GB with dedicated SD card slot | Dual SIM (nano+nano) dual standby (4G+4G)","review_title":"Excellent Phone in the budget segment,Best value for money...

My budget was around 20k max, and this one somehow fit in all ways. I had almost finalized one plus nord ce, but changed my mind at the last moment and I don't regret. I've used redmi phones before so I'm aware of the sturdiness and value for money they offer. Got this for 13k with close to 6k+ exchange on my one year old tecno spark 7 phone (one of the worst phones I've ever used, refer to my tecno spark 7 review for that). Here's my review of this phone based on 2 months of usage:Pros:1. Build quality is good. Finishing and lookwise it's sleek and quite comfortable in hand.2. Back camera is really good, better with the AI camera. The 108 MP gives good pictures, although not comparable to iPhone or Google pixel quality, but for the price range it's not bad. Portrait mode gives great pictures in well lit conditions, decent in low light with night mode.3. 67W charger is very efficient. Phone gets fully charged within 40-45 mins from below 10% battery levels. Battery backup is decent, with normal usage charge easily lasts for one and a half day or more.4. Dolby atmos dual speakers are really good! You could be watching movies on this and feel the surround sound through the speakers. Pretty loud too.5. No lagging and smooth touch, refresh rate is pretty good.6. Unlike some of the earlier Redmi phones or Chinese phones in general, there are negligible auto installing bloatwares. Android 11 performance so far has been satisfactory.7. Hasslefree usage in general, something that I struggled with a lot with my earlier Techno spark phone for basic functionalities.Cons:1. Front camera could've been a lot better. In daylight conditions, picture colors aren't vibrant enough, and in low light, pictures come grainy. Dissatisfied with that.2. Amoled display isn't as good as I had expected, especially becomes evident when light reflects on the screen while you're watching something.Nothing else worth mentioning that I can think of right now. May update this review if anything encountered.For people with 15-20k budget looking for a good overall usage phone having 5G, this phone  is worth a shot along with Nord CE 2 Lite.,Nice phone with good battery backup,fast charging, sturdy body and good process speed... camera quality is not good enough..but overall.. good budget phone..,1) Battery is decent2) Charging is very fast3) Camera is averagingOverall nice product,The phone is good from all aspects bug if ur looking for a good camera this is not the one.,The price of the product is higher at the time of launch.
