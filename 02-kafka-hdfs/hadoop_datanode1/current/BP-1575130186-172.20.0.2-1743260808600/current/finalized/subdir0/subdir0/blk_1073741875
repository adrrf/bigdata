Doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. I speak from my experience. My first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest August security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. The idle drain is very pronounced. However my second Iqoo z6 pro which I purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain .

No words for it's outstanding performance at price of  10,500Rs. It can even beat smartphones upto 15,000 Rs in camera department.Battery : for 45min ~ 5% charging gets discharged (used for quora, twitter, pininterest)For 18 min ~ 5% discharged(used for upto 500mb gaming apps)So, decent battery.Remember, display being amoled, full hd+ with high PPI consumes more battery.Generally, battery stays one and a half day, if used throughout the day without gaming.Display - very colourful, being amoled. But, only once I saw some colourful lines passing horizontally on display. But, that was only once. I hope it doesn't occur again.Edit : It happened because,  I removed some permissions from system apps. It never happened again.Tip : Try to keep brightness low, prefer dark mode for screen and use dark themes for apps to avoid  ghosting / screen burns in far future, in amoled display of all samsung mobiles.Heating : I can feel constant heat while holding it after using it for a longer period of time. But, it's not much.Want to know how much heat I feel? Well, it feels the same amount of heat which you generally feel on most budget phones after playing games or using mobiles for long time in low battery.Performance : No issue as others are making it out to be. You can play many games, its just not smooth in heavy games. In daily usage it doesn't lag.I have used SD 660 before, this has MTK G80 so near about it gives the same performance as that of SD660 OR we can even say, it gives a little better performance and is comparable to SD 662.I didn't play heavy games on this phone, but I did play games of about 2GB on my previous phone which had SD660. So, I think those games will work here without lag as well.Tip : Just because,  some people got defective piece doesn't mean you will too. And if you do see any manufacturing defect, then you can always place a replacement request within 7 days of delivery for defectjve or different product. And for damaged product you have to place replacement request before 2 days (read return policy for smartphones or check screenshot I uploaded)Now like my review, if you found it helpful!,Good smartphone for daily use, good battery life, doesn't hang much. My usage is normal and I don't play games, so did not experience heating issues. Received updates, now  running on Android 13 after latest update.,I write review after using this device almost 1 month 24 days.SAMSUNG GALAXY M32 PRIME EDITIONRAM: 4GBROM: 64GBCOLOUR: BLACK#AmazonSeLiyaI purchased it on Amzon Great Indian Festival.Ordered placed on 22 September 2022Ordered delivered on 26 September 2022.Delivery package was decent.It's a complete package within 11K price range.It's working absolutely fine in day to day normal usage. You can also play game like BGMI, FREE FIRE MAX, CALL OF DUTY without no lagging.Pros:1. Super Amoled Display2. Battery Backup (Normal usage 2.5 days & Hard usage 1.5 days), SOT(Screen On Time): Youtube video with 60% brightness approx 10hours+3. OneUI 4 Out of the box with Android 12.4. Network Connectivity.5. It's size. 6.4 inch display. Hand comfortable.6. 25W charging support.7. Virtual RAM upto 4gb.8.

Camera capturing sound turned off option is not present.4. No 4k video support.5. Speak volume was decent. Not much louder.6. Fingerprint is not fast.7. Face lock is not determine properly.8. No 4g+But It is a quality product from Samsung.If you get it around 11K price point then it's a great deal ever.Go for it if you don't need 5g.,Pros- 1. sAMOLED display,  2. 64mp Rear & 20mp Front camera,  3. One UI,  4. Knox security,  5. 6000mAh big battery.Cons- 1. Helio G80 Processor(should be at least Helio G96 or equal),  2. Lots of lags & Jittering issues. (It must be fixed & improved through software updates).  3. eMMC storage (should be UFS storage),  4. No carrier aggregation support.  5. Only 15w charger in the box (should be at least 18w or 20w fast charger).,Writing this review after using it for 6..7 months..my father is using this one..good for normal use. I bought it for around 14000.What I don't like about this phone is camera quality. Without flashlight the photos are quite good,but when we click pictures with flashlight on the quality is not good at all..so that’s the main concern in this phone.Hope this issue can be solved with a update.There is no heating problem, phone is working very smoothly.,I am writing this review after 3 month of use. Phone is overall good. Battery life is good. Display is also very good. Phone has no heating issue although I have not played any games on the phone.,Phone is good for normal use  display is very goodBut I  faced  some jitters in while display light goes off.. it happened many times before updated the phone after update it happens rarely...,Multiple issue in Samsung M32 .1.Lock Screen password issue. We can't reset the password if you get the lock screen password you have to reset mobile and there is no option for password reset.2.My Phone Samsung M32 is not getting charged after usage of 1 year.3.Sometimes phone is hang issue and not responding.4.I would recommend not to buy Samsung M series ,If you buy means you would face so many issue and will get frustration definitely.5.This is my first and last mobile in Samsung.","rating":4.1,"discount_percentage":4.0,"product_name":"Samsung Galaxy M32 Prime Edition (Light Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB)","discounted_price":12999.0,"rating_count":0.0,"user_id":"AEIOP36AQPGVLNNTDXHSUSVIRO3A,AEU76NMTP5BLAI4YLE37G5UXRMMA,AEVEJZ2RUY6RZ6GY5EIRES4BOUNA,AF2CSU2H5EC6MVKB3PWJPY7EITYA,AHRQKUYYOLHECU4IUH6OSL7AYM2Q,AE2Z7NYPJLUYMZ3GNEMYZ5RDRM6A,AE2WCZU5RXVCKNUTUJ4HCDTLU6OA,AESZ7VB66VS6APYVPSMUGOFI536A","product_id":"B0BD3T6Z1D","category":"Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones&BasicMobiles|Smartphones","about_product":"Segment Best 16.21 centimeters (6.4-inch) Super AMOLED - Infinity U-cut display, FHD+ resolution with 90Hz Refresh rate, 800 Nits High Brightness Mode, protected by Gorilla Glass 5|Versatile 64MP+8MP+2MP+2MP Quad camera setup-64MP (F 1.8) main camera + 8MP (F2.2) Ultra wide camera+ 2MP (F2.4) depth camera + 2MP (2.4) Macro Camera| 20MP (F2.2) front camera|Monster 6000 mAh Battery | Memory, Storage & SIM: 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 1TB| SIM 1 + SIM 2 + MicroSD|Android v12.0, One UI 4.1 operating system with MediaTek | Helio G80 Octa Core Processor 2GHz,1.8GHz|6000mAH lithium-ion battery, 1 year manufacturer warranty for device and 6 months manufacturer warranty for in-box accessories including batteries from the date of purchase","review_title":"Great, best 4g phone for around 10,500Rs,Good midrange phone,SAMSUNG GALAXY M32 PRIME EDITION (Pros & Cons),Great Phone but slow performance.,Good one,Good phone,Jitters,Many issues in Samsung M series","product_link":"https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Prime-Light-Blue/dp/B0BD3T6Z1D/ref=sr_1_193?qid=1672895806&s=electronics&sr=1-193"}

(my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarketOverall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty,Good,If you buy phone for camera purpose then don't buy this. But overall average mobile under this price.
